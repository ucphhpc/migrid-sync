A short description of changes 

=== January 22nd, 2021 ===
After almost two years of further development it's about time to make a new
release. Again we've implemented a load of new features with bug fixes and
security improvements as well. Some feature highlights include a brand new
stream-lined user interface with in-line help, personal Cloud instances,
additions and improvements to the sensitive data mode, a Peers system for
inviting external collaboration partners, Jupyter recipe-based workflows with
provenance support, authlog email notifications about login errors, several 2FA
improvements, account expiry+status control and experimental OpenID Connect
support.


=== February 27th, 2019 ===
Long due new release with plenty of added features especially in four
areas, namely an OpenSSH-based SFTP service, Jupyter integration, DOI 
integration for archives and a new site mode to host EU GDPR data with
the associated strict access and logging requirements.
In relation to that work we've a.o. added 2FA support, import from sharelinks
and archives, added helpers to ease use of Jupyter as an interactive
course infrastructure. Additionally the release includes a number of
security improvements across the board.


=== April 18th, 2017 ===
Mainly a security enhancing release, so we recommend that everyone
running a grid instance upgrades to this version.
Read-only VGrids/Workgroups was added recently and works for all new
VGrids if enabled in the configuration. Existing VGrids will keep
working but need manual migration to get read-only support.
Quite a lot of optimization in event daemon and several user interfaces.
Extended share link access to all IO daemons for efficient transfers.
Finally added greedy filling of available resources in jobs to make it
possible to request bare minimum requirements but make scheduler fill to
actually use whatever the resource offers.


=== July 31st, 2016 ===
Feature release. It's been another year with quite a lot of new
development in terms of new features and improvements, especially
data-centric additions coming from the ERDA and IDMC projects. Just to
mention a few we have added sharelinks for easy anonymous data exchange,
data transfers for flexible data import/export, a number of web
interface improvements including inline visual previews, better
international character support and flexible VGrid configuration for
e.g. fine grained access control.


=== August 27th, 2015 ===
Feature release. A lot of storage service features and improvements. New
OpenID, WebDAVS, FTPS and event trigger services. New fancy upload, persistent
archive support daemon and optional Seafile integration. Complete support for
site-specific web page skins.


=== February 20th, 2013 ===
Minor bugfix release.


=== January 30th, 2013 ===
Feature and minor bugfix release.


=== July 23rd, 2012 ===
Feature and minor bugfix release. Mainly the integration of the long
awaited interactive virtual machine jobs using VNC. Based on original
work by Tomas Groth and Simon A. F. Lund but updated and extended to
work with current VM images and virtualization technologies.


=== December 15th, 2011 ===
Feature and bugfix release.

SECURITY CHANGES:
* User settings moved to a dedicated user_settings dir to
  prevent any potential security issues with users manually crafting malign
  pickle files.
* Direct access to VGrid component dirs is completely disabled and an Apache
  guard against fake VGrid components is added. The existing CGI
  components were *not* vulnerable unless users somehow managed to bypass
  the prevention of setting the executable bit on their files. The changes
  are an extra layer of security for the CGIs and a safety precaution
  needed with the new WSGI components (where the executable is not needed
  for abuse).
* Require HTTP POST on potentially Cross-Site-Request-Forgery vulnerable
  pages like e.g. VGrid management.

The user settings change requires a MiGserver.conf addition and a manual
migration of old settings is recommend.
Typically the conf change is a matter of rerunning the conf generator or
adding a line like:
user_settings = %(state_path)s/user_settings/
The settings migration is a matter of moving
user_home/*/{.settings,.widgets,.userprofile} to the corresponding 
user_settings/*/{settings,widgets,userprofile} with a command like:
for name in settings widgets userprofile; do
    for i in `find state/user_home -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -name ".$name"`; do
        new=`echo $i|sed 's@user_home@user_settings@g'|sed "s@\.$name@$name@g"`;
	mkdir -p `dirname $new`
    	mv $i $new;
    done
done

The VGrid component changes are included in the configuration generator
so you should rerun the generator and replace or update your apache
configuration.

New exciting features include:
* Trac integration to provide tons of new VGrid collaboration tools
* SFTP server for efficient file access and sshfs mounting of your MiG home
* Powerful Grid user interface library for easy Grid application development
* People page for user profiles and communication


=== September 29th, 2010 ===
Bugfix releases to add missing 'shared' symlinks in various locations and fix
a number of smaller bugs.
Minor updates in layout and widgets.


=== August 3rd, 2010 ===
Feature and interface improvement release with thanks to grid.dk for a
considerable contribution especially in the usability and interface areas.
New feautures are mainly focused on improving VGrid usability, making job
execution more flexible and administrating resources.


=== March 15th, 2010 ===
Our previous shared virtual host for Session ID and certificate based
access could *potentially* open up for a Man-in-the-Middle attack like:
http://securitytracker.com/alerts/2009/Nov/1023145.html
Additionally the same SSL renegotiation prevented upload of big files
through the web interface. We repartitioned the virtual hosts to prevent
any such security issues in the future and remove the upload limit at
once. However, this means that a MiG server now requires either two public IP
adresses or two SSL ports to work.
Apart from that we mostly worked on integrating interface polishing and
improvements from the Grid.dk project. Now some of the main web pages
use AJAX to some extent for a far more flexible and crisp user experience.


=== September 17th, 2009 ===
********************************************************
*** IMPORTANT * This upgrade requires admin actions! ***
********************************************************
This release changed the user database format and the default location
of state directories. If you upgrade an existing installation you have
to at least migrate the user database and optionally move your state
directories to the new locations.

With the restructuring of the user database *all* existing installations
need to update their user database before they can use the new version.
Please backup all your state data and the MiG-users.db and run
cd mig/server
./migrateusers.py [OPTIONS]
Where OPTIONS may be one or more of:
   -c CONF_FILE        Use CONF_FILE as server configuration
   -d DB_FILE          Use DB_FILE as user data base file
   -f                  Force operations to continue past errors
   -h                  Show this help
   -p                  Prune duplicate users (keeps the one with latest expire)
   -v                  Verbose output              
which in most cases will be just
./migrateusers.py
to automatically upgrade all your MiG user directories and the database.
Run the migrateusers command with the -v flag for detailed informations
about applied changes.
You also need to update your apache MiG configuration to map SSL
certificates to the new user dirs.
If you choose to switch to the new relocatable state directory layout
you also need to update your MiGserver.conf and move the state
directories around.
Please refer to the example apache and MiGserver confs or use the config
generator to achieve this.
After migrating users you will have truly unique users, but you will no
longer be able to use the migrated data with older middleware versions.

=== May 1st, 2009 ===
We finally got the old grey web pages completely overhauled. Thanks to those of you 
that contributed to this often overlooked area.
Updated setup helpers to make custom install locations easier.


=== March 17, 2009 ===
Added this file for easier tracking of changes. Another bugfixing
release (1.0.2), so we recommend that everyone upgrades to this version.


=== March 06, 2009 ===
After a long time in planning we finally released the project under the
GPL v2 today. The project started all the way back in 2003, so there's
already quite a bit of code and the setup is not trivial. Over the
coming months we will improve the code and instructions to ease setup
for other users.
