= Modernization and Clean Up =
We will radually move code here in the on-going modedrnization and clean up
process.
That also means that any code placed here must comply with the project style
guide, be lint clean and have decent unit test coverage of all functions.

You may want to use autopep8, pylint, ruff or any available make lint target
to help verify.
