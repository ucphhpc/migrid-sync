                            <p>
                                There's no space quota as such on the general IDMC storage, but the huge
                                data sets known from high energy physics and bioinformatic databases are
                                examples of data contents <em>not</em> considered suitable for IDMC. Anything
                                within a few tens of terabytes should be fine, and we suggest that you
                                just have a word with us if you want to store more than that.<br/>
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">Is My IDMC Data Replicated and Backed Up?</h4>
                            <p>
                                All data on IDMC is automatically replicated over multiple disks with
                                RAID technology. We do <em>not</em> currently guarantee automatic and
                                complete backup of ordinary data in your IDMC home folder or in the
                                Workgroup shares.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">How do I Transfer Entire Folders to/from IDMC?</h4>
                            <p>
                                In the IDMC web interface you can only upload/download individual files,
                                so if you e.g. want to upload an entire folder structure there, first
                                pack the folder(s) in a zip or tar file, upload it as usual and then
                                use <em>unpack</em> from the right-click menu on the uploaded file.<br/>
                                Likewise you can use <em>pack</em> on a folder in IDMC, download and
                                unpack it locally.<br/>
                                Alternatively you can use the efficient file/folder handling described
                                in the Advanced Data Access sections of the user guide. That makes IDMC
                                appear like a network drive so that you can use your local file manager
                                to copy entire folders to IDMC.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">Can I Share, Exchange and Publish Data in e.g. a Read-only Fashion on IDMC?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Yes, depending on the audience and dynamics of the data to share you can
                                use one of two overall methods.<br/> 
                                For dynamic data you can either share in a read-write manner using
                                the Workgroup shares or make them read-only in the Workgroup
                                administration. Similarly you can do read-only sharing and publishing through the
                                Workgroup web pages. Both are built into the Workgroups and the web pages
                                come in a public and in a group-wide flavor, where the publishing is done
                                by Workgroup owners storing data in the public_base and private_base
                                workgroup subdirectories respectively on IDMC. Your Workgroups page
                                includes links to those and to the resulting web pages.<br/>
                                For quick data exchange with anyone and particularly people <em>not</em> on
                                IDMC, we recommend the Share Link feature. From your Files page you can
                                create a share link for a file or folder and choose what kind of read
                                and write access share link recipients should be granted. 
                                The share link method include the option to send out an
                                invitation with the link directly on email, but it can of course also be
                                manually distributed by other means. Share links can also be accessed
                                with SFTP, FTPS and WebDAVS as described in the user guide.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">How Are Workgroups Managed?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Workgroups can be created by academic staff (VIP) as well as
                                technical/administrative staff (TAP) and the creator of a
                                workgroup automatically becomes owner. All user management is left to
                                the owner(s) without interaction from the IDMC system
                                administrators. Co-owners and members can be added either directly using
                                the <em>Swedish numberplate</em> or email alias of the user, or
                                indirectly if the user requests owner-/membership on the Workgroups
                                page, and the owner(s) follow the instructions then sent on email about
                                adding the user with the full user ID format. We recommend the intro
                                guide on Workgroups for further details.

                            <p>
                                No, we <b>cannot</b> allow such accounts or account aliasing, mainly due to
                                rules and regulations. In case of suspected or alleged abuse we need to
                                be able to uniquely identify who did what and when, and all kinds of
                                anonymous or shared accounts would prevent that. Please refer to
                                the <a href="https://informationssikkerhed.ku.dk/english/is-policy/"

                                So basically you need to use your own personal and clearly identifiable
                                account for all logins. What you <b>can</b> do is to use Workgroups to
                                store data in a shared group folder. In that way the data is not bound
                                to your account specifically and you and your project group can easily
                                manage all account access yourselves through the Workgroup admin
                                page.<br/>
                                Similarly share links can be used for access to particular subfolders if
                                you need to e.g. automate data upload from lab machines without storing
                                your personal login there. Please refer to the user guide for more details.

                                IDMC prevents certain characters like 
                                "&lt; &gt; &#123; &#124; &#125; &#42; &#63; &#91; &#93;"
                                in file names. You may already have run into similar limitations when
                                naming files on your own PC or devices. In order to provide a secure and
                                consistent experience across different platforms, web and advanced

                                problems. Either because they are so-called control characters with a
                                special potentially dangerous meaning on the storage systems or because
                                they are known to interfere with the web interfacing and
                                presentation. We are continuously evaluating the need for allowing more
                                exotic characters but always with focus on not breaking existing
                                interfaces and backends. Feel free to contact us about the possibility
                                of allowing any additional characters that you may miss.

                                We've added Jupyter integration in IDMC, so that you can run interactive
                                data analysis sessions e.g. in a Python or R environment with direct
                                access to all your IDMC data.<br/>
                                A number of software packages are already available in the different
                                Jupyter instances, but sometimes you may still want to run
                                additional software there. Please refer to the section about
                                Jupyter Notebook Customization in the user guide for details.<br/>
                                We are working on a solution whith greater DIY customization of the

                                if you have additional permanent software wishes. Then we will see
                                if they can be fulfilled - but we can't give any promises.

                                If you already signed up to IDMC and had access but you begin
                                receiving such errors it is likely that you hit an
                                occasional problem we experience when UCPH IT changes primary
                                email address of users in their central user database. This
                                typically only happens in relation to significant employment
                                status changes. IDMC just relies on the UCPH OpenID service
                                for sign up and log in, so the change means that your existing
                                account with e.g. xyz123@alumni.ku.dk is no longer
                                recognized to belong to the ID, which UCPH OpenID tells us you
                                now have. Rest assured that your IDMC account remains intact, and
                                usually we can fix the problem by assigning the new primary
                                email alias to it. We just need you to contact us as

                            <h4 class="staticpage">Why do I get "Account disabled or expired" emails?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Since December 2020 we have enforced automatic WebDAVS/SFTP/FTPS
                                access expiry for all users in order to reduce the risk of no longer
                                active accounts being abused/hacked that way.
                                We have enforced automatic IDMC account expiry for longer for web
                                access. However, UCPH users automatically get their account renewed
                                when successfully logging into the web pages through the UCPH OpenID
                                service, while external users must explicitly renew their account
                                access annually using the sign up form on the front page. With account
                                expiry extended to cover the efficient I/O services any configured
                                access to our WebDAVS, SFTP or FTPS services will also automatically
                                expire when accounts do. Attempts to log in on those services after
                                general account expiry will fail and trigger an email warning that the
                                account is expired. In practice it has limited consequences for
                                external users, who already go through the annual renewal
                                process. UCPH users solely or mainly using IDMC as network drive
                                or through a WebDAVS/SFTP/FTPS client, will have to get used to
                                regularly renew account access to keep using said I/O services. This
                                can either be done for a whole year at a time by repeating 'sign up'
                                on the front page or for 30 days by a simple web log in. Thus, users
                                solely or regularly using the web access don't need to worry or do
                                anything new. Those who enabled 2-Factor authentication for all
                                IDMC account access can also just continue with their usual web
                                login before their I/O service logins.

                                Yes, as long as you need an IDMC account for a course, workshop or
                                project collaboration with one or more employees at UCPH it is
                                possible to get one - even if you don't have a general UCPH account.
                                <br/>
                                Just use the tabs at the top to switch between the different sign up

                                Vi håndhæver ikke som sådan pladskvoter på selve IDMC datalageret, men
                                kæmpe datasæt, som dem man kender fra højenergi-fysik eller
                                bioinformatik-databaser, er eksempler på indhold, som <em>ikke</em> regnes for
                                egnede til lagring på IDMC. Så længe vi taler datamængder op til en snes
                                terabytes, skulle der ikke være nogen problemer. Hvis du gerne vil gemme mere
                                end det, kan det sikkert også lade sig gøre - bare tag en snak med os om
                                det.<br/>

                            <h4 class="staticpage">Er mine IDMC data replikerede og med backup?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Al data på IDMC er automatisk replikeret over flere diske v.h.a.
                                RAID-teknologi. Vi garanterer <em>ikke</em> i øjeblikket automatisk og
                                fuldstændig backup af almindelige data i din IDMC brugerfolder eller i
                                Workgroup shares.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">Hvordan overfører jeg hele foldere til/fra IDMC?</h4>
                            <p>
                                På dine IDMC websider kan du kun uploade/downloade enkeltfiler, så hvis
                                du f.eks. vil uploade hele foldere den vej, må du først pakke dem i en
                                zip- eller tar-fil, som du derefter uploader som vanligt og endelig
                                udpakker med <em>unpack</em> fra højreklik-menuen på den uploadede
                                fil.<br/>
                                Tilsvarende kan du bruge <em>pack</em> på en IDMC folder, downloade den
                                pakkede fil og udpakke lokalt.<br/>
                                Alternativt kan du benytte den effektive fil/folder-håndtering som
                                beskrevet i afsnittene om Avanceret datatilgang i brugervejledningen. På
                                den måde kan IDMC tilgås som et netværksdrev så du kan benytte din
                                almindelige filhåndtering til at kopiere hele foldere til og fra IDMC.

                            <h4 class="staticpage">Kan jeg dele, udveksle og publicere IDMC data f.eks. så der kun er læse-adgang?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Ja, der er overordnet to forskellige måder at gøre det på afhængigt af
                                hvor dynamiske data er, og hvem du vil dele med.<br/> 
                                Når det drejer sig om dynamiske data er det muligt at dele med læse- og
                                skrive-adgang via de almindelige Workgroup shares, samt at skifte
                                sådanne shares til kun at give læse-adgang på administrationssiden. Det
                                er også muligt at lave skrivebeskyttet deling og publicering via de
                                tilknyttede Workgroup web sider. Begge følger automatisk med alle
                                Workgroups og sidstnævnte findes i en udgave med offentlig adgang og en
                                kun for gruppens deltagere. Publicering den vej foregår ved at Workgroup
                                ejere gemmer data i de tilhørende public_base hhv private_base workgroup
                                undermapper på IDMC. På din Workgroups side finder du links til disse og
                                til de resulterende web-sider.<br/>
                                Til hurtig udveksling af data med hvem som helst, herunder ikke mindst folk
                                som <em>ikke</em> er på IDMC, kan vi anbefale Share Link metoden. Fra
                                din Files side kan du oprette et share link og vælge hvilken kombination
                                af læse- og skrive-adgang modtageren skal gives. 
                                Share link metoden inkluderer muligheden for at udsende en invitation med link 
                                direkte på email, men det kan naturligvis også gøres manuelt via andre kanaler.

                                Videnskabeligt personale (VIP) såvel som teknisk/administrativt
                                personale (TAP) kan oprette workgroups og de bliver derved
                                automatisk ejere af den nye workgroup. Al brugerstyring er ejernes
                                ansvar og foregår uden indblanding fra systemadministratorerne på
                                IDMC. Medejere og medlemmer kan enten tilføjes direkte ved at indtaste
                                brugerens <em>svenske nummerplade</em> eller email på Workgroup
                                Management siden eller ved at brugere anmoder om owner-/membership på
                                Workgroups-siden, og ejerne følger de derved emailede instruktioner om
                                at tilføje brugeren vha det komplette bruger-ID. Vi henviser til
                                intro guiden om Workgroups for yderligere vejledning.

                            <p>
                                Nej, vi kan <b>ikke</b> tillade sådanne delte eller særskilte konti, især
                                pga love og regler. I tilfælde af mistanke eller anklager om
                                kontimisbrug er det strengt nødvendigt at vi entydigt kan afgøre præcis
                                hvem der gjorde hvad og hvornår. Det er helt uforeneligt med alle former
                                for anonyme eller delte konti. Vi henviser
                                til <a href="https://informationssikkerhed.ku.dk/politik/"

                                detaljer omkring krav omkring identitet og sporbarhed. Hvad
                                man <b>kan</b> gøre er at benytte Workgroups til at opbevare data i en
                                delt gruppemappe. På den måde er data ikke bundet specifikt til din
                                private konto og du og din projektgruppe kan nemt selv styre al
                                kontoadgang dertil via Workgroup'ens admin-side.<br/>
                                Det er desuden muligt at benytte sharelinks til at give adgang til
                                specifikke undermapper, i tilfælde af at man f.eks. har brug for at
                                automatisere data-upload fra laboratoriemaskiner uden at have sit
                                personlige login flydende rundt. Se venligst brugervejledningen for
                                nærmere detaljer.

                            <p>
                                IDMC afviser enkelte tegn så som 
                                "&lt; &gt; &#123; &#124; &#125; &#42; &#63; &#91; &#93;"
                                i filnavne. Måske du allerede har oplevet lignende begrænsninger i
                                navngivningen af filer på din PC eller andre enheder.
                                For at kunne levere en sikker og ensartet brugeroplevelse på tværs af
                                platforme, web og avancerede brugergrænseflader afviser IDMC disse og
                                visse andre som er kendt for at skabe problemer.
                                Hvadenten det er fordi de er såkaldte kontroltegn med en speciel og
                                potentielt skadelig betydning på lagersystemerne eller fordi de vides at
                                forstyrre web-brug og -visning. Vi evaluerer løbende på behovet for at
                                tillade yderligere eksotiske tegn, hele tiden under krav om hverken at
                                skade brugergrænseflader eller bagvedliggende systemer. Du er
                                naturligvis velkommen til at kontakte os angående at få yderligere tegn
                                du måtte savne tilladt.

                                Vi har integreret Jupyter i IDMC, så man som bruger kan lave interaktiv
                                dataanalyse i f.eks. Python eller R og med direkte adgang til alle sine
                                IDMC-data.<br/>
                                Jupyter-miljøet har forskellige images med en stribe software-pakker
                                installeret, men nogle gange kan det stadig være bekvemt at køre
                                yderligere special-software. Vi henviser til brugervejledningen og 
                                specielt afsnittet om Jupyter notebook tilpasning for de nærmere
                                detaljer.<br/>
                                Vi arbejder desuden på at udvikle en gør-det-selv tilpasning af
                                Jupyter-instanserne, så det i større omfang bliver muligt. Indtil da
                                er fremgangsmåden at skrive til vores support-email med evt ønsker
                                om permanent at få tilføjet yderligere software. Så undersøger vi om
                                det er muligt at tilføje - men vi kan ikke love noget.

                                "No such user (xyz123@ku.dk)?"</h4>
                            <p>
                                Såfremt du allerede har tilmeldt dig IDMC og haft adgang, men
                                begynder at få den slags fejl, har du sandsynligvis ramt et
                                problem vi engang imellem oplever når KU IT skifter primær
                                email-adresse på brugere i deres centrale
                                brugerdatabase. Det sker typisk kun i forbindelse med større 
                                ændringer i ansættelsesstatus. IDMC benytter bare KUs OpenID
                                service ved tilmelding og log in, så ændringerne betyder at
                                din eksisterende konto tilmeldt med
                                f.eks. xyz123@alumni.ku.dk ikke længere genkendes som
                                tilhørende det ID, som KUs OpenID fortæller os du nu har.
                                Du kan være ganske rolig ift at din IDMC-konto forbliver
                                intakt, og vi kan typisk løse problemet ved at tildele din
                                nye ID dertil. Vi har bare brug for at du kontakter os derom
                                som beskrevet nedenfor.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">Hvorfor modtager jeg "Account disabled or expired" emails?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Siden 1. december 2020 har vi håndhævet automatisk udløb på
                                WebDAVS/SFTP/FTPS-adgang for alle brugere, for at reducere risikoen
                                for at ikke længere aktive konti misbruges/hackes den vej.
                                Vi har i længere tid håndhævet automatisk kontoudløb på IDMC
                                web-adgang. KU-brugere får automatisk deres IDMC-konto forlænget
                                ved vellykket web-login gennem KUs OpenID service, mens eksterne
                                brugere eksplicit skal igennem årlig fornyelse af deres kontoadgang
                                vha tilmeldingsformularen fra forsiden. Udvidelsen af kontoudløb til
                                også at dække de effektive I/O-services betyder i praksis at al adgang
                                til WebDAVS, SFTP og FTPS også automatisk udløber sammen med
                                kontoen. Forsøg på at logge ind via disse I/O-services efter
                                kontoudløb vil fejle og medføre en advarsel på email om at kontoen er
                                udløbet. Konsekvenserne er små for eksterne brugere, som allerede skal
                                igennem den årlige fornyelse. KU-brugere som hovedsageligt eller kun
                                bruger IDMC som netværksdrev eller med SFTP/WebDAVS/FTPS-klient
                                skal derimod vænne sig til engang imellem aktivt at forlænge kontoen
                                for fortsat at benytte vores I/O services. Det kan enten ske for et
                                helt år af gangen ved at gentage 'tilmelding' på forsiden eller for 30
                                dage af gangen blot ved log ind på IDMC web. KU-brugere som
                                udelukkende eller jævnligt benytter sig af web-adgang behøver således
                                ikke bekymre sig eller gøre noget nyt. Dem der har tilvalgt 2-faktor
                                godkendelse for al IDMC konto-adgang, kan ligeledes blot
                                ufortrødent fortsætte med at logge ind på web inden deres I/O-service
                                logins.

                                eller et projektsamarbejde med en eller flere ansatte på KU, er det
                                muligt at få en konto - også selv om du ikke har en generel

                                brugervejledningen, benytter OpenID-login fra KU IT og er dermed
                                strengt knyttet til KUs brugerdatabase. Den kan derfor kun benyttes af
