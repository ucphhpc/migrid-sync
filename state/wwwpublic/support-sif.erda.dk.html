                            <p>
                                There's no space quota as such on the <!--general--> SIF storage. Anything
                                within a few <!-- tens of --> terabytes should be fine. We suggest that you
                                just have a word with us if you want to store more than that.<br/>
                                If you want to store non-sensitive data sets - especially big ones - we
                                recommend instead doing so on <a href="https://erda.ku.dk">ERDA</a>.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">Is my SIF Data Replicated and Backed Up?</h4>
                            <p>
                                All user data on SIF is automatically replicated over multiple disks
                                with RAID technology. We additionally run automatic nightly backup of
                                all SIF system and user data to a remote location.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">How are SIF Data Secured?</h4>
                            <p>SIF relies on the same mature open source software stack used in ERDA, but
                                with a number of additional security enhancements and with all potentially less
                                secure features disabled. E.g. it does not come with direct data export and
                                share links to reduce the risk of data leaks and avoid anonymous access of
                                any kind. SIF enforces mandatory 2-factor authentication for all access using
                                the TOTP industry standard for one-time passwords generated on your smart phone
                                or tablet. In effect this makes it a lot harder to obtain unauthorized access
                                even for an attacker who should somehow get hold of your password. Data on SIF
                                can generally only be accessed through security-hardened protocols and user
                                data is only ever stored to disk in encrypted form. That is, all data access
                                and storage rely on strong encryption standards. Additionally SIF strictly
                                separates data on a per-project basis to help users avoid leaking sensitive
                                data by mistake.<br/>
                                User data is only ever stored on UCPH premises, more precisely in the HPC
                                Center server rooms with physical access control. Management-wise SIF also
                                comes with even tighter regulation, where only a select few administrators can
                                obtain access to decrypted user data, and always only after explicit permission
                                from a superior. 
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">How do I Transfer Entire Folders to/from SIF?</h4>
                            <p>
                                For upload of an entire folder structure, you can use the efficient
                                file/folder handling described in the Efficient Data Access sections of
                                the <a href="/public/ucph-sif-user-guide.pdf">user guide</a>. That makes SIF appear like a network drive, so that you
                                can use your local file manager to copy entire folders to SIF.<br/>
                                Currently SIF web access is limited to only upload/download of individual
                                files.
                                <!--
                                     so if you e.g. want to upload an entire folder structure there, first
                                     pack the folder(s) in a zip or tar file, upload it as usual and then
                                     use <em>unpack</em> from the right-click menu on the uploaded file.<br/>
                                     Likewise you can use <em>pack</em> on a folder in SIF, download and
                                     unpack it locally.<br/>
                                     Alternatively you can use the efficient file/folder handling described
                                -->
                                We may decide to add pack/unpack support later, like it is the case on
                                ERDA.

                                in file names. You may already have run into similar limitations when
                                naming files on your own PC or devices. In order to provide a secure and
                                consistent experience across different platforms, web and advanced
                                interfaces SIF prohibits those and some more that are known to cause
                                problems. Either because they are so-called control characters with a
                                special potentially dangerous meaning on the storage systems or because
                                they are known to interfere with the web interfacing and
                                presentation. We are continuously evaluating the need for allowing more
                                exotic characters but always with focus on not breaking existing
                                interfaces and backends. Feel free to contact us about the possibility
                                of allowing any additional characters that you may miss.

                            <h4 class="staticpage">I forgot my password, can I recover or change it?"</h4>
                            <p>
                                For security reasons we generally avoid storing passwords in our
                                systems and only save a one-way derived <em>hash value</em>. Therefore
                                we <strong>cannot</strong> recover passwords, but we do allow you to
                                change it.<br/>
                                If you are an employee or student at KU/UCPH you typically log in to
                                SIF web through the UCPH OpenID authentication service. It is linked
                                to the central UCPH user database and therefore employs your usual UCPH
                                credentials from e.g. KU Mail and KU Net (usernames are on the form
                                <em>abc123</em>). If you forgot your KU/UCPH password or e.g. it
                                expired you need to go through UCPH password change procedures or get
                                in touch with 
                                <a class="urllink" href="https://it.ku.dk/english/contact/">UCPH IT
                                    Support</a>.<br/>
                                If you are an external user on SIF you can always use the External
                                user <em>sign up</em> button again to renew access and/or change your
                                main SIF password. Just fill the sign up form as usual including your
                                particular ID fields, the mandatory name and email of your UCPH contact
                                and a note that you want to change password in the Comment field.<br/>
                                The other SIF services like SFTP and WebDAVS rely on local login
                                credentials and you can change them yourself on your SIF Setup page.

                            <h4 class="staticpage">What about timely removal of GDPR data, the right to rectification, withdrawal of consent, etc.?"</h4>
                            <p>
                                Some data sets come with a maximum data rention time after which they
                                must either be permanently deleted or fully anonymized. Typically this
                                is the case for research projects involving GDPR data, which require
                                prior legal approval and come with a time-limited permission to store
                                and analyze the associated personal data. In some cases it may be
                                possible to extend the time-limit, but you will generally always have
                                to act when the deadline approaches. Your Faculty Secretariat can help
                                you regarding the rules and will perhaps even remind you about pending
                                data expiry. As a project owner on SIF it is solely your responsibilty
                                to take care of proper removal of such data in a timely manner. Either
                                by deleting the relevant project folders or by removing the project
                                altogether with Remove Project from the main SIF project management
                                page.
                                GDPR additionally offers data subjects a number of rights in general,
                                including rectification of incorrect data about them and to withdraw
                                their consent, in which case removal of their data from the data set
                                may be required. Please note, however, that certain exceptions apply
                                regarding these rights when it comes to processing of personal data
                                for e.g. scientific and statistical purposes, so please have a word
                                with your local legal experts first. In order to make sure such
                                incorrect or removed data does not by mistake get restored from
                                backup, it is your responsibility as SIF project owner to inform the
                                SIF administrators about any such GDPR inquiries and actions. Namely,
                                letting us know the SIF project name, the date and time of the
                                changes you made to correct or remove a person's data and optionally
                                the specific names of files changed to narrow the scope. Then we will
                                register it and make sure to either delete the corresponding data from
                                previous backups if possible or more likely just refuse to restore any
                                copies of the data from backup earlier than that point in time.

                            <h4 class="staticpage">What's the cause of "read: Connection reset by peer" errors e.g. for SSHFS?</h4>
                            <p>
                                That error message is a common symptom of a firewall ban at SIF. We
                                experience regular password guessing attacks and rely on a self-defense
                                system to monitor login attempts and act on apparent cracking or abuse
                                attempts. In practice it automatically bans IP addresses temporarily
                                when we receive too many failed login attempts over a certain period of
                                time. The ban period depends on the login pattern and simple repeated
                                password failures usually only result in a 15 minute ban. More
                                aggressive scans and failures on the other hand may trigger a 24 hour
                                ban, while the most blatant cracking attempts result in a 24 day ban.
                                For multi-user systems and computers behind a shared gateway these bans
                                unfortunately may result in not only the offender but also several
                                other users or computers getting affected by the ban. In the sense that
                                they are no longer able to reach SIF until the ban expires or gets
                                manually lifted by the site administrators. Thus, please contact us on
                                SIF support if you hit this issue and it remains so even after 15
                                minutes without further login attempts. If you include the public IP
                                address that you connect from (<a href="https://ip.me">ip.me</a>) it's
                                a significant help to investigate and getting any unnecessary bans
                                lifted without further delay.

                                     No, unfortunately not at the moment. Technically we <em>are</em> ready to
                                     provide external access without UCPH credentials, but our legal department at
                                     the university hasn't yet established the required procedures and contracts to
                                     allow it. We're working together to get it all settled, however, and it's
                                     getting close.

                                     Yes, as long as you need a SIF account for a project collaboration
                                     with one or more employees at UCPH it is possible to get one, even if you
                                     don't have a general UCPH account. Likewise it is possible to preserve
                                     access to your SIF account beyond your employment at UCPH in case you
                                     need it to keep collaborating with a remaining employee.

                                     the OpenID login from Koncern-IT / University IT and they strictly use
                                     the UCPH user database. So only users with an account there can use that login.
                                     <br />
                                     However, we provide two alternative access methods, namely a similar

                                     another one relying on user certificates for added security.

                                Vi håndhæver ikke som sådan pladskvoter på selve SIF datalageret. 
                                Sålænge vi taler datamængder op til <!-- en snes-->
                                terabytes, skulle der ikke være nogen problemer. Hvis du gerne vil gemme
                                mere end det, kan det sikkert også lade sig gøre - bare tag en snak med
                                os om det.<br/>
                                Hvis du ønsker at lagre ikke-sensitive datasæt - især de større af slagsen -
                                anbefaler vi i stedet at benytte <a href="https://erda.ku.dk">ERDA</a> til
                                formålet.

                            <p>
                                Al brugerdata på SIF er automatisk replikeret over flere diske v.h.a.
                                RAID-teknologi. Vi kører desuden hver nat automatisk backup af alle SIF
                                system- og brugerdata til en fjernlokation.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">Hvordan er data sikret på SIF?</h4>
                            <p>SIF benytter den samme modne open source software-stak som ERDA, men med en
                                række yderligere sikkerhedstiltag og med alle potentielt mindre sikre
                                funktioner slået fra. Herunder f.eks. direkte dataeksport og share links, både
                                for a mindske risikoen for datalæk og for at undgå alle former for anonym
                                dataadgang. SIF håndhæver obligatorisk 2-faktor-autentificering ved al adgang
                                v.h.a. TOTP-industristandarden for engangskoder genereret på din smart phone
                                eller tablet. I praksis bliver uautoriseret adgang derved markant sværere, selv
                                for en angriber, som på en eller anden vis måtte have skaffet sig adgang til dit
                                kodeord. Data på SIF kan gennemgående kun tilgåes via sikkerhedshærdede
                                protokoller, og brugerdata gemmes altid kun på disk i krypteret form. D.v.s. al
                                dataadgang og lagring benytter stærk kryptering. Yderligere separerer SIF
                                strengt brugerdata på projektbasis, for at hjælpe brugere undgå ved en fejl at
                                lække sensitive data.<br/>
                                Brugerdata gemmes ene og alene på KU-ejendom, nærmere bestemt i HPC Centerets
                                serverrum med fysisk adgangskontrol. Driftmæssigt er SIF også underlagt ekstra
                                streng regulering, så kun et fåtal af administratorer kan opnå adgang til
                                dekrypteret brugerdata, og altid kun med eksplicit forudgående godkendelse fra
                                en overordnet.

                                På den måde kan SIF tilgåes som et netværksdrev så du kan benytte din
                                almindelige filhåndtering til at kopiere hele foldere til og fra SIF.<br/>
                                I øjeblikket understøtter SIF web-interfacet kun at man

                                     du f.eks. vil uploade hele foldere den vej, må du først pakke dem i en
                                     zip- eller tar-fil, som du derefter uploader som vanligt og endelig
                                     udpakker med <em>unpack</em> fra højreklik-menuen på den uploadede
                                     fil.<br/>
                                     Tilsvarende kan du bruge <em>pack</em> på en SIF folder, downloade den
                                     pakkede fil og udpakke lokalt.<br/>
                                     Alternativt kan du benytte den effektive fil/folder-håndtering som

                                For at kunne levere en sikker og ensartet brugeroplevelse på tværs af
                                platforme, web og avancerede brugergrænseflader afviser SIF disse og

                                potentielt skadelig betydning på lagersystemerne eller fordi de vides at
                                forstyrre web-brug og -visning. Vi evaluerer løbende på behovet for at
                                tillade yderligere eksotiske tegn, hele tiden under krav om hverken at

                            <p>
                                Nogle datasæt er underlagt krav om begrænset opbevaringstid, hvorefter
                                de enten skal slettes helt eller anonymiseres fuldt ud. Det er typisk
                                tilfældet for forskningsprojekter med persondata, som altid kræver
                                forudgående juridisk godkendelse og i den forbindelse tildeles en
                                tidsbegrænset tilladelse til at opbevare og analysere de tilhørende
                                personhenførbare data. I nogle tilfælde er det muligt at få forlænget
                                tilladelsen, men du skal generelt altid agere når udløbsdatoen nærmer

                                måske endda om snarligt udløb af tilladelsen. Som projektejer på SIF er
                                det dit fulde ansvar at sørge for passende og rettidig fjernelse af

                                GDPR giver som udgangspunkt også de registrerede et antal yderligere

                                samt at tilbagetrække deres samtykke og dermed i nogle tilfælde krav
                                om sletning af deres data fra et datasæt. Bemærk dog at der specifikt
                                gælder nolge undtagelser for disse rettigheder ved behandling af

                                tal først med dine lokale juridiske eksperter derom. 
                                Det er ligeledes dit ansvar som projektejer at hjælpe os sikre imod at
                                sådanne fejlagtige eller slettede data ved en fejl bliver genskabt fra
                                backup. Det gør du i praksis ved at give os besked om den slags
                                GDPR-henvendelser og din konkrete håndtering af dem. Nærmere bestemt
                                SIF projektnavnet, dato og klokkeslæt for dine ændringer for at rette
                                eller slette en persons data, evt plus specifikke navne på de ændrede
                                filer for at indsnævre omfanget. Så registrerer vi det og sørger for
                                enten at slette de pågældende data fra tidligere backups om muligt,
                                eller mere sandsynligt bare at afvise eventuelle anmodninger om at
                                genskabe sikkerhedskopier af filerne fra en ældre dato.

                            <p>
                                Fejlbeskeden er typisk et symptom på firewall-blokering på SIF. Vi
                                oplever jævnligt automatiserede forsøg på at gætte kodeord fra mørke
                                afkroge af internettet og benytter et selvforsvars-system til at
                                overvåge og handle når det ser tegn på mulige angreb eller misbrug. I
                                praksis blokerer det automatisk IP-adresser midlertidigt når vi
                                modtager for mange fejlede login-forsøg over en givet tidsrum.
                                Blokeringens varighed afhænger af login-mønsteret så simple gentagne
                                forkerte kodeord typisk kun fører til en 15 minutters blokering. Mere
                                ihærdige skanninger eller systematiske gæt fører derimod til en
                                24-timers blokering, mens der ved oplagte ondsindede angreb blokeres i
                                24 dage.
                                For flerbrugersystemer og computere bag en delt gateway kan
                                blokeringerne uheldigvis føre til at ikke kun synderen, men også 
                                adskillige andre brugere eller computere bliver berørt. D.v.s. spærret
                                fra at kunne forbinde til SIF indtil blokeringen enten udløber eller
                                manuelt fjernes af en administrator. Kontakt os derfor venligst på
                                SIF-support hvis du oplever blokering og det ikke er gået væk efter 15
                                minutter uden yderligere login-forsøg. Hvis du medsender den offentlige
                                IP-adresse du forbinder fra (se <a href="https://ip.me">ip.me</a>) er
                                det en væsentlig hjælp til at vi hurtigst muligt kan undersøge sagen og
                                fjerne evt unødvendige blokeringer.

                                Eksterne brugere uden et KU login kan få adgang til eksisterende SIF projekter.
                                Dette kræver en forhåndsgodkendelse fra den juridiske afdeling på det fakultet som 
                                er ansvarlig for projektetet. Eksterne brugere kan kun få adgang

                                     Nej, desværre ikke på nuværende tidspunkt. Rent teknisk <em>kunne</em> vi godt
                                     give ekstern adgang uden KU-konto, men vores juridiske afdeling på
                                     universitetet har endnu ikke etableret de nødvendige procedurer og kontrakter
                                     for at vi har lov til det. Vi arbejder dog sammen for at få det på plads og er tæt på.

                                     Ja, sålænge du har brug for en SIF-konto til et projektsamarbejde med
                                     en eller flere ansatte på KU, er det muligt at få en sådan, også selv om
                                     du ikke har en generel KU-konto. Ligeledes er det muligt at beholde
                                     adgang til din SIF-konto efter endt ansættelse, såfremt du har brug for
                                     den til samarbejde med en vedblivende ansat.
                                     <br/>
                                     <span class="warningtext">
                                     VIGTIGT: bemærk at KU-ledelsen har bedt om at sådanne brugere som ikke
                                     er ansat på KU registrerer sig med eksplicit tilknytning til en lokal
                                     bruger. Så henvis venligst til din samarbejdspartner/vejleder på KU Science i
                                     kommentarfeltet når du anmoder om OpenID- eller certifikat-adgang i
                                     formularen beskrevet nedenfor.
                                     </span>

                                     Vores generelle adgangskontrol med brugernavn+kode, som beskrevet i
                                     brugervejledningen, benytter OpenID-login fra KU Koncern-IT og er dermed
                                     strengt knyttet til KUs brugerdatabase. Den kan derfor kun benyttes af
                                     brugere med en KU-konto.
                                     <br />
                                     Vi tilbyder dog to alternativer for adgang uden en KU-konto. Den ene er
                                     ligeledes med brugernavn+kode via vores egen selvstændige OpenID-login
                                     service og den anden benytter brugercertifikater for ekstra høj sikkerhed.
                                     <br/>
                                     Du kan tilmelde dig SIF og få OpenID-adgang til din konto vha

                                     under <a class="migoidsignup-link">tilmelding</a>. 
                                     Såfremt du allerede har en SIF-konto, som du blot gerne vil bevare
                                     OpenID-adgang til, kan du benytte selvsamme side. Blot skal du være
                                     opmærksom på at udfylde formularens felter, så de stemmer nøjagtig
                                     overens med din nuværende konto. Spørg endelig hvis du er i tvivl.
                                     <br/>
                                     Når systemadministratorerne på SIF har godkendt din OpenID-konto/adgang, kan du
                                     bruge din registrerede emailadresse sammen med din selvvalgte kode
