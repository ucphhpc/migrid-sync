                            <p>
                                There's no space quota as such on the <!--general--> SIF storage. Anything
                                within a few <!-- tens of --> terabytes should be fine. We suggest that you
                                just have a word with us if you want to store more than that.<br/>
                                If you want to store non-sensitive data sets - especially big ones - we
                                recommend instead doing so on <a href="https://erda.ku.dk">ERDA</a>.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">Is my SIF Data Replicated and Backed Up?</h4>
                            <p>
                                All user data on SIF is automatically replicated over multiple disks
                                with RAID technology. We additionally run automatic nightly backup of
                                all SIF system and user data to a remote location.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">How are SIF Data Secured?</h4>
                            <p>SIF relies on the same mature open source software stack used in ERDA, but
                                with a number of additional security enhancements and with all potentially less
                                secure features disabled. E.g. it does not come with direct data export and
                                share links to reduce the risk of data leaks and avoid anonymous access of
                                any kind. SIF enforces mandatory 2-factor authentication for all access using
                                the TOTP industry standard for one-time passwords generated on your smart phone
                                or tablet. In effect this makes it a lot harder to obtain unauthorized access
                                even for an attacker who should somehow get hold of your password. Data on SIF
                                can generally only be accessed through security-hardened protocols and user
                                data is only ever stored to disk in encrypted form. That is, all data access
                                and storage rely on strong encryption standards. Additionally SIF strictly
                                separates data on a per-project basis to help users avoid leaking sensitive
                                data by mistake.<br/>
                                User data is only ever stored on UCPH premises, more precisely in the HPC
                                Center server rooms with physical access control. Management-wise SIF also
                                comes with even tighter regulation, where only a select few administrators can
                                obtain access to decrypted user data, and always only after explicit permission
                                from a superior. 
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">How do I Transfer Entire Folders to/from SIF?</h4>
                            <p>
                                For upload of an entire folder structure, you can use the efficient
                                file/folder handling described in the Efficient Data Access sections of
                                the <a href="/public/ucph-sif-user-guide.pdf">user guide</a>. That makes SIF appear like a network drive, so that you
                                can use your local file manager to copy entire folders to SIF.<br/>
                                Currently SIF web access is limited to only upload/download of individual
                                files.
                                <!--
                                     so if you e.g. want to upload an entire folder structure there, first
                                     pack the folder(s) in a zip or tar file, upload it as usual and then
                                     use <em>unpack</em> from the right-click menu on the uploaded file.<br/>
                                     Likewise you can use <em>pack</em> on a folder in SIF, download and
                                     unpack it locally.<br/>
                                     Alternatively you can use the efficient file/folder handling described
                                -->
                                We may decide to add pack/unpack support later, like it is the case on
                                ERDA.

                                in file names. You may already have run into similar limitations when
                                naming files on your own PC or devices. In order to provide a secure and
                                consistent experience across different platforms, web and advanced
                                interfaces SIF prohibits those and some more that are known to cause
                                problems. Either because they are so-called control characters with a
                                special potentially dangerous meaning on the storage systems or because
                                they are known to interfere with the web interfacing and
                                presentation. We are continuously evaluating the need for allowing more
                                exotic characters but always with focus on not breaking existing
                                interfaces and backends. Feel free to contact us about the possibility
                                of allowing any additional characters that you may miss.

                                We provide external user access with non-UCPH credentials, 
                                but for legal reasons this access requires explicit prior acceptance 
                                from the relevant faculty legal unit and such external users 
                                can only be invited to join existing SIF projects owned by a UCPH employee.

                                     No, unfortunately not at the moment. Technically we <em>are</em> ready to
                                     provide external access without UCPH credentials, but our legal department at
                                     the university hasn't yet established the required procedures and contracts to
                                     allow it. We're working together to get it all settled, however, and it's
                                     getting close.

                                     Yes, as long as you need a SIF account for a project collaboration
                                     with one or more employees at UCPH it is possible to get one, even if you
                                     don't have a general UCPH account. Likewise it is possible to preserve
                                     access to your SIF account beyond your employment at UCPH in case you
                                     need it to keep collaborating with a remaining employee.

                                     IMPORTANT: please note that UCPH management requires all such users not

                                     user. So please include a reference to your associate/advisor at UCPH

                                     Our general username+password access described in the user guide relies on
                                     the OpenID login from Koncern-IT / University IT and they strictly use
                                     the UCPH user database. So only users with an account there can use that login.
                                     <br />
                                     However, we provide two alternative access methods, namely a similar
                                     username+password login using our own separate OpenID login service, and
                                     another one relying on user certificates for added security.

                                     You can sign up for an SIF account with OpenID access with the

                                     up</a> page. If you already have an SIF account and just want to
                                     enable this OpenID login before your UCPH login expires you can use the
                                     same procedure, but then you need to make sure you enter the exact same account
                                     fields in the signup form. Please ask us if in doubt.

                                     you can use your registered email address along with your chosen

                                RAID-teknologi. Vi kører desuden hver nat automatisk backup af alle SIF
                                system- og brugerdata til en fjernlokation.

                            <h4 class="staticpage">Hvordan er data sikret på SIF?</h4>
                            <p>SIF benytter den samme modne open source software-stak som ERDA, men med en
                                række yderligere sikkerhedstiltag og med alle potentielt mindre sikre
                                funktioner slået fra. Herunder f.eks. direkte dataeksport og share links, både
                                for a mindske risikoen for datalæk og for at undgå alle former for anonym
                                dataadgang. SIF håndhæver obligatorisk 2-faktor-autentificering ved al adgang
                                v.h.a. TOTP-industristandarden for engangskoder genereret på din smart phone
                                eller tablet. I praksis bliver uautoriseret adgang derved markant sværere, selv
                                for en angriber, som på en eller anden vis måtte have skaffet sig adgang til dit
                                kodeord. Data på SIF kan gennemgående kun tilgåes via sikkerhedshærdede
                                protokoller, og brugerdata gemmes altid kun på disk i krypteret form. D.v.s. al
                                dataadgang og lagring benytter stærk kryptering. Yderligere separerer SIF
                                strengt brugerdata på projektbasis, for at hjælpe brugere undgå ved en fejl at

                                serverrum med fysisk adgangskontrol. Driftmæssigt er SIF også underlagt ekstra
                                streng regulering, så kun et fåtal af administratorer kan opnå adgang til
                                dekrypteret brugerdata, og altid kun med eksplicit forudgående godkendelse fra
                                en overordnet.

                            <p>
                                For upload af hele foldere kan du benytte den effektive 
                                fil/folder-håndtering som beskrevet i afsnittene om Effektiv datatilgang 
                                i <a href="/public/ucph-sif-brugervejledning.pdf">brugervejledningen</a>. 
                                På den måde kan SIF tilgåes som et netværksdrev så du kan benytte din
                                almindelige filhåndtering til at kopiere hele foldere til og fra SIF.<br/>
                                I øjeblikket understøtter SIF web-interfacet kun at man
                                uploader/downloader enkeltfiler. 
                                <!--, så hvis
                                     du f.eks. vil uploade hele foldere den vej, må du først pakke dem i en
                                     zip- eller tar-fil, som du derefter uploader som vanligt og endelig
                                     udpakker med <em>unpack</em> fra højreklik-menuen på den uploadede
                                     fil.<br/>
                                     Tilsvarende kan du bruge <em>pack</em> på en SIF folder, downloade den
                                     pakkede fil og udpakke lokalt.<br/>
                                     Alternativt kan du benytte den effektive fil/folder-håndtering som
                                -->
                                Vi overvejer om vi på sigt vil tilbyde funktioner til at pakke/udpakke
                                arkivfiler ligesom på ERDA.

                            <p>
                                SIF afviser enkelte tegn så som 
                                "&lt; &gt; &#123; &#124; &#125; &#42; &#63; &#91; &#93;"
                                i filnavne. Måske du allerede har oplevet lignende begrænsninger i
                                navngivningen af filer på din PC eller andre enheder.
                                For at kunne levere en sikker og ensartet brugeroplevelse på tværs af
                                platforme, web og avancerede brugergrænseflader afviser SIF disse og
                                visse andre som er kendt for at skabe problemer.
                                Hvadenten det er fordi de er såkaldte kontroltegn med en speciel og
                                potentielt skadelig betydning på lagersystemerne eller fordi de vides at
                                forstyrre web-brug og -visning. Vi evaluerer løbende på behovet for at
                                tillade yderligere eksotiske tegn, hele tiden under krav om hverken at
                                skade brugergrænseflader eller bagvedliggende systemer. Du er
                                naturligvis velkommen til at kontakte os angående at få yderligere tegn
                                du måtte savne tilladt.

                                Eksterne brugere uden et KU login kan få adgang til eksisterende SIF projekter.
                                Dette kræver en forhåndsgodkendelse fra den juridiske afdeling på det fakultet som 
                                er ansvarlig for projektetet. Eksterne brugere kan kun få adgang
                                til SIF projekter som er ejet af en KU ansat.

                                     Nej, desværre ikke på nuværende tidspunkt. Rent teknisk <em>kunne</em> vi godt
                                     give ekstern adgang uden KU-konto, men vores juridiske afdeling på
                                     universitetet har endnu ikke etableret de nødvendige procedurer og kontrakter
                                     for at vi har lov til det. Vi arbejder dog sammen for at få det på plads og er tæt på.

                                     Ja, sålænge du har brug for en SIF-konto til et projektsamarbejde med
                                     en eller flere ansatte på KU, er det muligt at få en sådan, også selv om
                                     du ikke har en generel KU-konto. Ligeledes er det muligt at beholde
                                     adgang til din SIF-konto efter endt ansættelse, såfremt du har brug for
                                     den til samarbejde med en vedblivende ansat.

                                     VIGTIGT: bemærk at KU-ledelsen har bedt om at sådanne brugere som ikke
                                     er ansat på KU registrerer sig med eksplicit tilknytning til en lokal
                                     bruger. Så henvis venligst til din samarbejdspartner/vejleder på KU Science i
                                     kommentarfeltet når du anmoder om OpenID- eller certifikat-adgang i
                                     formularen beskrevet nedenfor.

                                     Vores generelle adgangskontrol med brugernavn+kode, som beskrevet i
                                     brugervejledningen, benytter OpenID-login fra KU Koncern-IT og er dermed
                                     strengt knyttet til KUs brugerdatabase. Den kan derfor kun benyttes af
                                     brugere med en KU-konto.
                                     <br />
                                     Vi tilbyder dog to alternativer for adgang uden en KU-konto. Den ene er
                                     ligeledes med brugernavn+kode via vores egen selvstændige OpenID-login
                                     service og den anden benytter brugercertifikater for ekstra høj sikkerhed.

                                     Du kan tilmelde dig SIF og få OpenID-adgang til din konto vha

                                     Såfremt du allerede har en SIF-konto, som du blot gerne vil bevare
                                     OpenID-adgang til, kan du benytte selvsamme side. Blot skal du være
                                     opmærksom på at udfylde formularens felter, så de stemmer nøjagtig
                                     overens med din nuværende konto. Spørg endelig hvis du er i tvivl.
                                     <br/>
                                     Når systemadministratorerne på SIF har godkendt din OpenID-konto/adgang, kan du
