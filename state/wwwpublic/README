This directory is for public files on migrid sites and all files are visible in
the root on the plain HTTP virtual host and through /public/ on the HTTPS
virtual hosts.

For UI V3 support in About, Support and Status popups on user pages it is
necessary to add about-snippet.html, support-snippet.html and tips-snippet.html
files or symlinks to the sample site files with a similar prefix.
Same applies for the common terms of use which may be added or symlinked to
the site file with similar name.

In order to support the standard security reporting framework 
https://securitytxt.org/
one should also add a security.txt file in the .well-known/ sub-folder or
symlink it to one of the existing site specific files there. Additional
references to responsible disclosure policy and gpg pub keys can be added or
symlinked in as well.

The letsencrypt symlink and the .well-known/acme-challenge are used for the
optional LetsEncrypt certificate setup.

The monitor, archives and public vgrid files should automatically be included here.
