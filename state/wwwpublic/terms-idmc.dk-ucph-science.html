                    <h2>Terms</h2>
                    <p>
                        These terms of service (the "Terms") govern your access to and use of
                        IDMC ("we" or "our") websites and services (the "Services"), so
                        please carefully read them before using the Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are
                        using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to
                        these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the
                        authority to bind that organization to these terms. In that case, "you"
                        and "your" will refer to that organization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms. You may
                        use the Services only if you have the power to form a contract with
                        IDMC and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. The
                        Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add more
                        features. We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time
                        without prior notice to you. We may also remove any content from our
                        Services at our discretion.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Your Privacy</h2>
                    <p>
                        By using our Services you provide us with information, files, and
                        folders that you submit to IDMC (together, "your stuff"). You retain
                        full ownership to your stuff. We don't claim any ownership to any of
                        it. These Terms do not grant us any rights to your stuff or intellectual
                        property except for the limited rights that are needed to run the
                        Services, as explained below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may need your permission to do things you ask us to do with your
                        stuff, for example, hosting your files, or sharing them at your
                        direction. This includes product features visible to you, for example
                        document previews. It also includes design choices we make to
                        technically administer our Services, for example, how we redundantly
                        backup data to keep it safe. You give us the permissions we need to do
                        those things solely to provide the Services. This permission also
                        extends to any trusted third parties at UCPH we work with to provide the Services,
                        for example University IT, which provides our UCPH OpenID login (again, only to
                        provide the Services).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We won't disclose to parties outside IDMC files stored in your
                        IDMC account and information about you that we collect except we
                        have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a)
                        comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect
                        the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c)
                        prevent fraud or abuse of IDMC or its users; or (d) to protect
                        IDMC's property rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of your files
                        and folders, and your communications with others while using the
                        Services. For example, it's your responsibility to ensure that you have
                        the rights or permission needed to comply with these Terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may choose to review public content for compliance with our community
                        guidelines, but you acknowledge that IDMC has no obligation to
                        monitor any information on the Services. We are not responsible for the
                        accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, or legality of files, user
                        posts, or any other information you may be able to access using the
                        Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please refer to the privacy and cookie policy links at the bottom for details
                        about our handling of the information you provide during user registration
                        and use of the Services as well as which state information we save in
                        browser cookies.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Sharing Your Stuff</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Services provide features that allow you to share your stuff with
                        others or to make it public. There are many things that users may do
                        with that stuff (for example, copy it, modify it, re-share it). Please
                        consider carefully what you choose to share or make public. IDMC has
                        no responsibility for that activity.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>
                        Files and other content in the Services may be protected by intellectual
                        property rights of others. Similarly, certain data may be protected by
                        national or international export or privacy laws, like the European
                        Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) for personal data.
                        Please do not copy, upload, download, or share files unless you have the
                        right and all required legal permissions to do so. You, not IDMC, will
                        be fully responsible and liable for what you copy, share, upload,
                        download or otherwise use while using the Services. You must not upload
                        spyware or any other malicious software to the Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You, and not IDMC, are responsible for maintaining and protecting
                        all of your stuff. IDMC will not be liable for any loss or
                        corruption of your stuff, or for any costs or expenses associated with
                        backing up or restoring any of your stuff.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Account Security</h2>
                    <p>
                        You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access
                        the Services and you agree not to disclose your password to any third
                        party. You are responsible for any activity using your account, whether
                        or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify
                        IDMC of any unauthorized use of your account. You acknowledge that
                        if you wish to protect your transmission of data or files to IDMC,
                        it is your responsibility to use a secure encrypted connection to
                        communicate with the Services.
                    </p>

                    <h2>IDMC is Available "AS-IS"</h2>
                    <p>
                        Though we want to provide a great service, there are certain things
                        about the service we can't promise. For example, THE SERVICES AND
                        SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", AT YOUR OWN RISK, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR
                        IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY
                        WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
                        NON-INFRINGEMENT. IDMC will have no responsibility for any harm to
                        your computer system, loss or corruption of data, or other harm that
                        results from your access to or use of the Services or Software. Some
                        states do not allow the types of disclaimers in this paragraph, so they
                        may not apply to you.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
                    <p>
                        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL IDMC, ITS
                        AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE
                        LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR
                        CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS)
                        DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT IDMC HAS BEEN
                        WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF
                        ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING
                        TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU
                        TO IDMC FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Modifications</h2>
                    <p>
                        We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version
                        will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our sole
                        discretion, is material we will notify you (for example via email to the
                        email address associated with your account). Other changes may be posted
                        to the terms page, so please check those pages regularly. By continuing
                        to access or use the Services after revisions become effective, you
                        agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new
                        terms, please stop using the Services.
