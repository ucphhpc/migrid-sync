                                There's no space quota as such on the general MiGrid
                                storage, but we do recommend using our ERDA/IDMC services
                                for any larger data sets. Anything within a few tens of
                                gigabytes should be fine, and we suggest that you 
                                just have a word with us if you want to store more than that.<br/>

                            <h4 class="staticpage">Is My MiGrid Data Replicated and Backed Up?</h4>
                            <p>
                                All data on MiGrid is automatically replicated over multiple disks with
                                RAID technology. We do run complete nightly backups of all
                                user data to another host but we do <em>not</em> currently
                                guarantee the complete backup availability of ordinary data
                                in your MiGrid home folder or in the VGrid shares. Please
                                contact us if in doubt about this or use e.g. our ERDA
                                service with freeze archives if that is essential.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">How do I Transfer Entire Folders to/from MiGrid?</h4>
                            <p>
                                In the MiGrid web interface you can only upload/download individual files,
                                so if you e.g. want to upload an entire folder structure there, first
                                pack the folder(s) in a zip or tar file, upload it as usual and then
                                use <em>unpack</em> from the right-click menu on the uploaded file.<br/>
                                Likewise you can use <em>pack</em> on a folder in MiGrid, download and
                                unpack it locally.<br/>
                                Alternatively you can use the efficient file/folder handling described
                                in the Advanced Data Access sections of the user guide. That makes MiGrid
                                appear like a network drive so that you can use your local file manager
                                to copy entire folders to MiGrid.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">Can I Share, Exchange and Publish Data in e.g. a Read-only Fashion on MiGrid?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Yes, depending on the audience and dynamics of the data to share you can
                                use one of two overall methods.<br/> 
                                For dynamic data you can either share in a read-write manner using
                                the VGrid shares or make them read-only in the VGrid
                                administration. Similarly you can do read-only sharing and publishing through the
                                VGrid web pages. Both are built into the VGrids and the web pages
                                come in a public and in a group-wide flavor, where the publishing is done
                                by VGrid owners storing data in the public_base and private_base
                                VGrid subdirectories respectively on MiGrid. Your VGrids page
                                includes links to those and to the resulting web pages.<br/>
                                For quick data exchange with anyone and particularly people <em>not</em> on
                                MiGrid, we recommend the Share Link feature. From your Files page you can
                                create a share link for a file or folder and choose what kind of read
                                and write access share link recipients should be granted. 
                                The share link method include the option to send out an
                                invitation with the link directly on email, but it can of course also be
                                manually distributed by other means. Share links can also be accessed
                                with SFTP, FTPS and WebDAVS as described in the user guide.
                            </p>

                                VGrid automatically becomes owner. All user management is left to
                                the owner(s) without interaction from the MiGrid system
                                administrators. Co-owners and members can be added either directly using
                                the <em>Swedish numberplate</em> or email alias of the user, or
                                indirectly if the user requests owner-/membership on the VGrids
                                page, and the owner(s) follow the instructions then sent on email about
                                adding the user with the full user ID format.

                            <h4 class="staticpage">Can I have a shared or separate account for our project?</h4>
                            <p>
                                No, we <b>cannot</b> allow such accounts or account aliasing, mainly due to
                                rules and regulations. In case of suspected or alleged abuse we need to
                                be able to uniquely identify who did what and when, and all kinds of
                                anonymous or shared accounts would prevent that. Please refer to
                                the <a href="https://informationssikkerhed.ku.dk/english/is-policy/"
                                       target="_blank">UCPH information security policy</a> for further details
                                about identity and traceability requirements.<br/>
                                So basically you need to use your own personal and clearly identifiable
                                account for all logins. What you <b>can</b> do is to use VGrids to
                                store data in a shared group folder. In that way the data is not bound
                                to your account specifically and you and your project group can easily
                                manage all account access yourselves through the VGrid admin
                                page.<br/>
                                Similarly share links can be used for access to particular subfolders if
                                you need to e.g. automate data upload from lab machines without storing
                                your personal login there. Please refer to the user guide for more details.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="staticpage">Why can't I use certain characters in file names?</h4>
                            <p>
                                MiGrid prevents certain characters like 
                                "&lt; &gt; &#123; &#124; &#125; &#42; &#63; &#91; &#93;"
                                in file names. You may already have run into similar limitations when
                                naming files on your own PC or devices. In order to provide a secure and
                                consistent experience across different platforms, web and advanced
                                interfaces MiGrid prohibits those and some more that are known to cause
                                problems. Either because they are so-called control characters with a
                                special potentially dangerous meaning on the storage systems or because
                                they are known to interfere with the web interfacing and
                                presentation. We are continuously evaluating the need for allowing more
                                exotic characters but always with focus on not breaking existing
                                interfaces and backends. Feel free to contact us about the possibility
                                of allowing any additional characters that you may miss.

                            <h4 class="staticpage">Why do I get "Account disabled or expired" emails?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Since December 2020 we have enforced automatic WebDAVS/SFTP/FTPS
                                access expiry for all users in order to reduce the risk of no longer
                                active accounts being abused/hacked that way.
                                We have enforced automatic MiGrid account expiry for longer for web
                                access. However, UCPH users automatically get their account renewed
                                when successfully logging into the web pages through the UCPH OpenID
                                service, while external users must explicitly renew their account
                                access annually using the sign up form on the front page. With account
                                expiry extended to cover the efficient I/O services any configured
                                access to our WebDAVS, SFTP or FTPS services will also automatically
                                expire when accounts do. Attempts to log in on those services after
                                general account expiry will fail and trigger an email warning that the
                                account is expired. In practice it has limited consequences for
                                external users, who already go through the annual renewal
                                process. UCPH users solely or mainly using MiGrid as network drive
                                or through a WebDAVS/SFTP/FTPS client, will have to get used to
                                regularly renew account access to keep using said I/O services. This
                                can either be done for a whole year at a time by repeating 'sign up'
                                on the front page or for 30 days by a simple web log in. Thus, users
                                solely or regularly using the web access don't need to worry or do
                                anything new. Those who enabled 2-Factor authentication for all
                                MiGrid account access can also just continue with their usual web
                                login before their I/O service logins.

                            <p>
                                In case you want the extra secure access you need to request and
                                install one of our grid certificates as described on the
                                corresponding <a class="reqcert-en-link">getting started</a> page. As
                                you can see in the user-cert-import guide there, the certificate install
                                process takes quite a few steps, but then at least login gets simpler
                                afterwards. After installing your certificate you can use it first to
                                <a class="extcertsignup-link">sign up</a> for your MiGrid account and then
                                afterwards to <a class="extcertlogin-link">log in</a>.

                            <h4 class="staticpage">Hvordan overfører jeg hele foldere til/fra MiGrid?</h4>
                            <p>
                                På dine MiGrid websider kan du kun uploade/downloade enkeltfiler, så hvis
                                du f.eks. vil uploade hele foldere den vej, må du først pakke dem i en
                                zip- eller tar-fil, som du derefter uploader som vanligt og endelig
                                udpakker med <em>unpack</em> fra højreklik-menuen på den uploadede
                                fil.<br/>
                                Tilsvarende kan du bruge <em>pack</em> på en MiGrid folder, downloade den
                                pakkede fil og udpakke lokalt.<br/>
                                Alternativt kan du benytte den effektive fil/folder-håndtering som
                                beskrevet i afsnittene om Avanceret datatilgang i brugervejledningen. På
                                den måde kan MiGrid tilgås som et netværksdrev så du kan benytte din
                                almindelige filhåndtering til at kopiere hele foldere til og fra MiGrid.

                            <h4 class="staticpage">Kan jeg dele, udveksle og publicere MiGrid data f.eks. så der kun er læse-adgang?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Ja, der er overordnet to forskellige måder at gøre det på afhængigt af
                                hvor dynamiske data er, og hvem du vil dele med.<br/> 
                                Når det drejer sig om dynamiske data er det muligt at dele med læse- og
                                skrive-adgang via de almindelige VGrid shares, samt at skifte
                                sådanne shares til kun at give læse-adgang på administrationssiden. Det
                                er også muligt at lave skrivebeskyttet deling og publicering via de
                                tilknyttede VGrid web sider. Begge følger automatisk med alle
                                VGrids og sidstnævnte findes i en udgave med offentlig adgang og en
                                kun for gruppens deltagere. Publicering den vej foregår ved at VGrid
                                ejere gemmer data i de tilhørende public_base hhv private_base VGrid
                                undermapper på MiGrid. På din VGrids side finder du links til disse og
                                til de resulterende web-sider.<br/>
                                Til hurtig udveksling af data med hvem som helst, herunder ikke mindst folk
                                som <em>ikke</em> er på MiGrid, kan vi anbefale Share Link metoden. Fra
                                din Files side kan du oprette et share link og vælge hvilken kombination
                                af læse- og skrive-adgang modtageren skal gives. 
                                Share link metoden inkluderer muligheden for at udsende en invitation med link 
                                direkte på email, men det kan naturligvis også gøres manuelt via andre kanaler.

                            <p>
                                Alle kan oprette VGrids og de bliver derved
                                automatisk ejere af det nye VGrid. Al brugerstyring er ejernes
                                ansvar og foregår uden indblanding fra systemadministratorerne på
                                MiGrid. Medejere og medlemmer kan enten tilføjes direkte ved at indtaste
                                brugerens <em>svenske nummerplade</em> eller email på VGrid
                                Management siden eller ved at brugere anmoder om owner-/membership på
                                VGrids-siden, og ejerne følger de derved emailede instruktioner om
                                at tilføje brugeren vha det komplette bruger-ID.

                            <p>
                                Nej, vi kan <b>ikke</b> tillade sådanne delte eller særskilte konti, især
                                pga love og regler. I tilfælde af mistanke eller anklager om
                                kontimisbrug er det strengt nødvendigt at vi entydigt kan afgøre præcis
                                hvem der gjorde hvad og hvornår. Det er helt uforeneligt med alle former
                                for anonyme eller delte konti. Vi henviser
                                til <a href="https://informationssikkerhed.ku.dk/politik/"
                                       target="_blank">KUs Informationssikkerhedspolitik</a> for nærmere

                                man <b>kan</b> gøre er at benytte VGrids til at opbevare data i en
                                delt gruppemappe. På den måde er data ikke bundet specifikt til din
                                private konto og du og din projektgruppe kan nemt selv styre al
                                kontoadgang dertil via pågældende VGrids admin-side.<br/>
                                Det er desuden muligt at benytte sharelinks til at give adgang til
                                specifikke undermapper, i tilfælde af at man f.eks. har brug for at
                                automatisere data-upload fra laboratoriemaskiner uden at have sit
                                personlige login flydende rundt. Se venligst brugervejledningen for
                                nærmere detaljer.

                            <h4 class="staticpage">Hvorfor er der tegn jeg ikke kan bruge i filnavne?</h4>
                            <p>
                                MiGrid afviser enkelte tegn så som 
                                "&lt; &gt; &#123; &#124; &#125; &#42; &#63; &#91; &#93;"
                                i filnavne. Måske du allerede har oplevet lignende begrænsninger i
                                navngivningen af filer på din PC eller andre enheder.
                                For at kunne levere en sikker og ensartet brugeroplevelse på tværs af
                                platforme, web og avancerede brugergrænseflader afviser MiGrid disse og
                                visse andre som er kendt for at skabe problemer.
                                Hvadenten det er fordi de er såkaldte kontroltegn med en speciel og
                                potentielt skadelig betydning på lagersystemerne eller fordi de vides at
                                forstyrre web-brug og -visning. Vi evaluerer løbende på behovet for at
                                tillade yderligere eksotiske tegn, hele tiden under krav om hverken at
                                skade brugergrænseflader eller bagvedliggende systemer. Du er
                                naturligvis velkommen til at kontakte os angående at få yderligere tegn
                                du måtte savne tilladt.

                                Siden 1. december 2020 har vi håndhævet automatisk udløb på
                                WebDAVS/SFTP/FTPS-adgang for alle brugere, for at reducere risikoen
                                for at ikke længere aktive konti misbruges/hackes den vej.
                                Vi har i længere tid håndhævet automatisk kontoudløb på MiGrid
                                web-adgang. KU-brugere får automatisk deres MiGrid-konto forlænget
                                ved vellykket web-login gennem KUs OpenID service, mens eksterne
                                brugere eksplicit skal igennem årlig fornyelse af deres kontoadgang
                                vha tilmeldingsformularen fra forsiden. Udvidelsen af kontoudløb til
                                også at dække de effektive I/O-services betyder i praksis at al adgang
                                til WebDAVS, SFTP og FTPS også automatisk udløber sammen med
                                kontoen. Forsøg på at logge ind via disse I/O-services efter
                                kontoudløb vil fejle og medføre en advarsel på email om at kontoen er
                                udløbet. Konsekvenserne er små for eksterne brugere, som allerede skal
                                igennem den årlige fornyelse. KU-brugere som hovedsageligt eller kun
                                bruger MiGrid som netværksdrev eller med SFTP/WebDAVS/FTPS-klient
                                skal derimod vænne sig til engang imellem aktivt at forlænge kontoen
                                for fortsat at benytte vores I/O services. Det kan enten ske for et
                                helt år af gangen ved at gentage 'tilmelding' på forsiden eller for 30
                                dage af gangen blot ved log ind på MiGrid web. KU-brugere som
                                udelukkende eller jævnligt benytter sig af web-adgang behøver således
                                ikke bekymre sig eller gøre noget nyt. Dem der har tilvalgt 2-faktor
                                godkendelse for al MiGrid konto-adgang, kan ligeledes blot
                                ufortrødent fortsætte med at logge ind på web inden deres I/O-service
                                logins.
