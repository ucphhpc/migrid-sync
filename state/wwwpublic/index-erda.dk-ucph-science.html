getting started and making the most of your account.
</p>

<h2 class="staticpage">About UCPH ERDA</h2>
<p>
University of Copenhagen - Electronic Research Data Archive (UCPH ERDA or just ERDA) is a 
storage, sharing and archiving facility provided by University of Copenhagen to
employees and students. For now it is limited to the faculty of Science,
but it may be extended to all of UCPH in the future.
ERDA delivers centralized storage space for personal and shared files in
addition to archiving of e.g. PhD theses and research data for
safe-keeping and publishing. It also comes with a file synchronization
service similar to Dropbox, but with the data stored locally at UCPH.
</p>

<h2 class="staticpage">Sensitive and Personal Data (GDPR)</h2>
<p>
Please note that while ERDA comes with a strong security focus, it is
<em>only</em> a solution approved for general scientific data
and <em>not</em> for highly sensitive data. In particular it is not for
personal data classified as sensitive in the EU Regulation 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation). In case you need to work on such
sensitive data we recommend the ERDA sister
facility <a href="http://sif.ku.dk">SIF</a>, which <em>is</em>
intended and approved for exactly that purpose.
</p>

<h2 class="staticpage">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<div class="faq-accordion">
<h4 class="staticpage">How much storage space do I have on ERDA?</h4>
<p>
There's no space quota as such on the general ERDA storage, but the huge
data sets known from high energy physics and bioinformatic databases are
examples of data contents <em>not</em> considered suitable for ERDA. Anything
within a few tens of terabytes should be fine, and we suggest that you
just have a word with us if you want to store more than that.<br/>
ERDA also includes a file synchronization service called Seafile, and
that particular part may not be so suitable for big data sets, so it
comes with a quota of 100 GB per user.
</p>
<h4 class="staticpage">Is My ERDA Data Replicated and Backed Up?</h4>
<p>
All data on ERDA is automatically replicated over multiple disks with
RAID technology. We do <em>not</em> currently guarantee automatic and
complete backup of ordinary data in your ERDA home folder or in the
Workgroup shares. That would simply not make sense for the biggest data
sets there. So only files explicitly duplicated with the Archive feature
get backed up to tape. This includes eventual remote tape backup for
extra safety.
We recommend our Seafile file synchronization service for any small to
medium sized data sets, for which you want automatic file
versioning. With that solution you generally have the ability to recover
deleted files or 'roll back' files to earlier versions.
</p>
<h4 class="staticpage">How do I Transfer Entire Folders to/from ERDA?</h4>
<p>
In the ERDA web interface you can only upload/download individual files,
so if you e.g. want to upload an entire folder structure there, first
pack the folder(s) in a zip or tar file, upload it as usual and then
use <em>unpack</em> from the right-click menu on the uploaded file.<br/>
Likewise you can use <em>pack</em> on a folder in ERDA, download and
unpack it locally.<br/>
Alternatively you can use the efficient file/folder handling described
in the Advanced Data Access sections of the user guide. That makes ERDA
appear like a network drive so that you can use your local file manager
to copy entire folders to ERDA.
</p>
<h4 class="staticpage">Can I Share, Exchange and Publish Data in e.g. a Read-only Fashion on ERDA?</h4>
<p>
Yes, depending on the audience and dynamics of the data to share you can
use one of three overall methods.<br/> 
For permanent read-only publishing just create a new archive from your
Archives page and make sure to mark it for public availability.<br/>
For more dynamic data you can either share in a read-write manner using
the Workgroup shares or make them read-only in the Workgroup
administration. Similarly you can do read-only sharing and publishing through the
Workgroup web pages. Both are built into the Workgroups and the web pages
come in a public and in a group-wide flavor, where the publishing is done
by Workgroup owners storing data in the public_base and private_base
workgroup subdirectories respectively on ERDA. Your Workgroups page
includes links to those and to the resulting web pages.<br/>
For quick data exchange with anyone and particularly people <em>not</em> on
ERDA, we recommend the Share Link feature. From your Files page you can
create a share link for a file or folder and choose what kind of read
and write access share link recipients should be granted. A similar
feature applies for any data you may store in our optional Seafile data
synchronization service. Just use the <em>share by email</em> feature to
similarly create upload or download shares with optional password and
time limit. Both share link methods include the option to send out an
invitation with the link directly on email, but they can of course also be
manually distributed by other means. Share links can also be accessed
with SFTP, FTPS and WebDAVS as described in the user guide.
</p>
<h4 class="staticpage">Is it possible to get a DOI for my ERDA archive?</h4>
<p>
Yes, since June 2018 we integrate DOI registration.</br>
A number of users have asked about the possibility of assigning a
Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to their published ERDA archives. It is
getting more common to use such DOIs in research papers in line with the
open-access and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">Open science</a> spirit.
UCPH has a license to mint DOIs
through <a href="https://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a> and University
IT has developed a service to help do that, which we've integrated with
ERDA. In practice you create your ERDA freeze archive as usual and
select <em>yes</em> for Make Dataset Publicly Available. When satisfied
with the archive contents you click <b>Finalize archive</b> to
permanently freeze it. Afterwards you can use the <b>Request archive DOI</b>
button on the View archive details page to proceed with the UCPH DOI
registration form. At KUNet you can find a more
<a href="https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/data-management-at-UCPH/data-doi/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">elaborate DOI introduction</a> including a complete
visual walk-through of the process to create an archive and assign a DOI.
</p>
<h4 class="staticpage">How Are Workgroups Managed?</h4>
<p>
Workgroups can be created by VIP and TAP employees and the creator of a
workgroup automatically becomes owner. All user management is left to
the owner(s) without interaction from the ERDA system
administrators. Co-owners and members can be added either directly using
the <em>Swedish numberplate</em> or email alias of the user, or
indirectly if the user requests owner-/membership on the Workgroups
page, and the owner(s) follow the instructions then sent on email about
adding the user with the full user ID format.
</p>
<!-- NOTE: commented out since this is no longer an issue with autologout -->
<!--
<h4 class="staticpage">New ERDA user: why do I get 'No such user' or 'No ID information received'?</h4>
<p>
Basically you need to go through <i>sign up</i> before you can start using
ERDA - as described in the user guide.<br/>
If you try <i>log in</i> first anyway, you may end up in a bit of a vicious
circle with those messages once you attempt to sign up. Please try the
following steps if so:<br/>
1) Open up a web browser and go to the ERDA start page
<a href="http://erda.ku.dk">http://erda.ku.dk</a> (here)<br />
2) Click the <b>sign up</b> button at the top left<br />
3a) If you are greeted with a KU login screen like the one on page 5 in
the user guide, you are on the right track and can just fill it to finish
sign up and proceed to using ERDA.<br />
3b) If on the other hand you reach the <i>No ID information received</i>
warning page, it means you are already partially logged in and need to
first go through a few extra steps: click the <b>Logout</b> link on that
page and click the <b>Yes</b> button on the resulting ERDA logout
page. When it says <i>logged out</i> you first close the active browser
tab and then your entire web browser, before you repeat the steps from
(1) to hopefully reach (3a) this time.
</p>
-->
<h4 class="staticpage">Why can't I use certain characters in file names?</h4>
<p>
ERDA prevents certain characters like 
"&lt; &gt; &#123; &#124; &#125; &#42; &#63; &#91; &#93;"
in file names. You may already have run into similar limitations when
naming files on your own PC or devices. In order to provide a secure and
consistent experience across different platforms, web and advanced
interfaces ERDA prohibits those and some more that are known to cause
problems. Either because they are so-called control characters with a
special potentially dangerous meaning on the storage systems or because
they are known to interfere with the web interfacing and
presentation. We are continuously evaluating the need for allowing more
exotic characters but always with focus on not breaking existing
interfaces and backends. Feel free to contact us about the possibility
of allowing any additional characters that you may miss.
<h4 class="staticpage">How do I install and run software XYZ in Jupyter?</h4>
<p>
We've added Jupyter integration in ERDA, so that you can run interactive
data analysis sessions e.g. in a Python or R environment with direct
access to all your ERDA data.<br/>
A number of software packages are already available in the different ERDA
Jupyter instances, but sometimes you may still want to run additional
software there. For Python and Jupyter extension packages it may work to simply
install temporarily with pip or pip3 inside the session via
the <em>Terminal</em> in the main Jupyter <em>Launcher</em> window, or
by writing a standard Python <em>requirements.txt</em> file in your ERDA
home and run it interactively with something like
<tt>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</tt> from the Jupyter Terminal.<br/>
Alternatively you can install Python software dependencies like e.g. the
scikit-image package directly in the Jupyter Notebook itself by evaluating
<tt>!pip3 install scikit-image</tt> in a cell.<br/>
At the moment installing software that requires compilation or come with other
external dependencies is typically not supported. We're
working on a framework to allow some self-service customization of the
Jupyter instances. Until then you can contact us at our support email if
you have additional software wishes. Then we will see if they can be
fulfilled - but we can't give any promises.
</p>
<h4 class="staticpage">Can I get or keep an ERDA account without a UCPH account?</h4>
<p>
Yes, as long as you need an ERDA account for a project collaboration
with one or more employees at UCPH it is possible to get one, even if you
don't have a general UCPH account. Likewise it is possible to preserve
access to your ERDA account beyond your employment at UCPH in case you
need it to keep collaborating with a remaining employee.
<br/>
<span class="warningtext">
IMPORTANT: please note that UCPH management requires all such users not
employed at UCPH to explicitly register with their affiliation to a local
user. So please include a reference to your associate/advisor at UCPH
Science in the comment field when you fill in the OpenID or certificate
account request described below.
</span>
<br />
Our general username+password access described in the user guide relies on
the OpenID login from Koncern-IT / University IT and they strictly use
the UCPH user database. So only users with an account there can use that login.
<br />
However, we provide two alternative access methods, namely a similar
username+password login using our own separate OpenID login service, and
another one relying on user certificates for added security. 
<br/>
You can sign up for an ERDA account with OpenID access with the
<em>Other User OpenID Signup</em> button on the <a class="migoidsignup-link">sign
  up</a> page. If you already have an ERDA account and just want to
enable this OpenID login before your UCPH login expires you can use the
same procedure, but then you need to make sure you enter the exact same account
fields in the signup form. Please ask us if in doubt.
<br/>
After the ERDA admins accept your OpenID account/access request
you can use your registered email address along with your chosen
password for <a class="migoidlogin-link">log in</a>.
<br/>
In case you want the extra secure access instead you need to request and
install one of our grid certificates as described on the
corresponding <a class="reqcert-en-link">getting started</a> page. As
you can see in the user-cert-import guide there, the certificate install
process takes quite a few steps, but then at least login gets simpler
afterwards. After installing your certificate you can use it first to
<a class="extcertsignup-link">sign up</a> for your ERDA account and then
afterwards to <a class="extcertlogin-link">log in</a>.

<a href="https://erda.dk/public/ucph-erda-brugervejledning.pdf">

til at komme igang og f친 st칮rst nytte af din konto.
</p>

<h2 class="staticpage">Om UCPH ERDA</h2>
<p>
University of Copenhagen - Electronic Research Data Archive (UCPH ERDA
eller blot ERDA) er et lager-, delings- og arkiveringssystem leveret af
K칮benhavns Universitet til ansatte og studerende. I f칮rste omgang er det
begr칝nset til Det natur- og biovidenskabelige fakultet (Science), men p친
l칝ngere sigt vil det muligvis blive udbredt til hele KU.
ERDA leverer centraliseret lagerplads for personlige - og delte filer samt
arkiveringsfaciliteter til f.eks. Ph.D.-afhandlinger og forskningsdata
for datasikring og publicering. Desuden tilbydes en
filsynkroniserings-service i stil med Dropbox, men med datalagringen
lokalt p친 KU.
</p>

<h2 class="staticpage">F칮lsomme - og personhenf칮rbare data (GDPR)</h2>
<p>
Bem칝rk venligst at selvom ERDA har fokus p친 st칝rk sikkerhed, s친 er det
<em>kun</em> en l칮sning til generelle forskningsdata og <em>ikke</em>
til f칮lsomme data. Herunder specielt ikke personhenf칮rbare data
klassificeret som f칮lsomme i EUs persondataforordning (forordning
2016/679, ogs친 kendt som GDPR). S친fremt du har behov for at arbejde p친
s친danne sensitive data anbefaler vi i stedet at benytte ERDAs
s칮ster-facilitet <a href="http://sif.ku.dk">SIF</a>, som
netop <em>er</em> beregnet og godkendt til det form친l.
</p>

<h2 class="staticpage">Ofte stillede sp칮rgsm친l (OSS)</h2>
<div class="faq-accordion">
<h4 class="staticpage">Hvor meget plads har jeg p친 ERDA?</h4>
<p>
Vi h친ndh칝ver ikke som s친dan pladskvoter p친 selve ERDA datalageret, men
k칝mpe datas칝t, som dem man kender fra h칮jenergi-fysik eller
bioinformatik-databaser, er eksempler p친 indhold, som <em>ikke</em> regnes for
egnede til lagring p친 ERDA. S친 l칝nge vi taler datam칝ngder op til en snes
terabytes, skulle der ikke v칝re nogen problemer. Hvis du gerne vil gemme
mere end det, kan det sikkert ogs친 lade sig g칮re - bare tag en snak med
os om det.<br/>
ERDA inkluderer ogs친 en filsynkroniserings-service ved navn Seafile, og
den er sandsynligvis ikke s친 velegnet til k칝mpe datas칝t, s친 den har en 100 GB
kvote for hver bruger.
</p>
<h4 class="staticpage">Er mine ERDA data replikerede og med backup?</h4>
<p>
Al data p친 ERDA er automatisk replikeret over flere diske v.h.a.
RAID-teknologi. Vi garanterer <em>ikke</em> i 칮jeblikket automatisk og
fuldst칝ndig backup af almindelige data i din ERDA brugerfolder eller i
Workgroup shares. For de st칮rste datas칝t d칠r giver det simpelthen
sj칝ldent mening med s친dan automatisk backup. S친 kun filer som eksplicit
er gemt som Archive bliver der gemt backup af. Det inkluderer ogs친
efterf칮lgende automatisk kopi til b친nd p친 en fjernlokation for ekstra
sikkerhed.
Vi anbefaler vores Seafile filsynkroniserings-service til sm친 og
mellemstore datas칝t, for hvilke man 칮nsker automatisk filversionering. I
den l칮sning har man generelt mulighed for at kunne genskabe slettede
filer eller 'spole tilbage' til tidligere versioner.
</p>
<h4 class="staticpage">Hvordan overf칮rer jeg hele foldere til/fra ERDA?</h4>
<p>
P친 dine ERDA websider kan du kun uploade/downloade enkeltfiler, s친 hvis
du f.eks. vil uploade hele foldere den vej, m친 du f칮rst pakke dem i en
zip- eller tar-fil, som du derefter uploader som vanligt og endelig
udpakker med <em>unpack</em> fra h칮jreklik-menuen p친 den uploadede
fil.<br/>
Tilsvarende kan du bruge <em>pack</em> p친 en ERDA folder, downloade den
pakkede fil og udpakke lokalt.<br/>
Alternativt kan du benytte den effektive fil/folder-h친ndtering som
beskrevet i afsnittene om Avanceret datatilgang i brugervejledningen. P친
den m친de kan ERDA tilg친s som et netv칝rksdrev s친 du kan benytte din
almindelige filh친ndtering til at kopiere hele foldere til og fra ERDA.
</p>
<h4 class="staticpage">Kan jeg dele, udveklse og publicere ERDA data f.eks. s친 der kun er l칝se-adgang?</h4>
<p>
Ja, der er overordnet tre forskellige m친der at g칮re det p친 afh칝ngigt af
hvor dynamiske data er, og hvem du vil dele med.<br/> 
Permanent skrive-beskyttet publicering g칮res bedst med Archives og
markering af at data skal arkiveres offentligt.<br/>
N친r det drejer sig om dynamiske data er det muligt at dele med l칝se- og
skrive-adgang via de almindelige Workgroup shares, samt at skifte
s친danne shares til kun at give l칝se-adgang p친 administrationssiden. Det
er ogs친 muligt at lave skrivebeskyttet deling og publicering via de
tilknyttede Workgroup web sider. Begge f칮lger automatisk med alle
Workgroups og sidstn칝vnte findes i en udgave med offentlig adgang og en
kun for gruppens deltagere. Publicering den vej foreg친r ved at Workgroup
ejere gemmer data i de tilh칮rende public_base hhv private_base workgroup
undermapper p친 ERDA. P친 din Workgroups side finder du links til disse og
til de resulterende web-sider.<br/>
Til hurtig udveksling af data med hvem som helst, herunder ikke mindst folk
som <em>ikke</em> er p친 ERDA, kan vi anbefale Share Link metoden. Fra
din Files side kan du oprette et share link og v칝lge hvilken kombination
af l칝se- og skrive-adgang modtageren skal gives. En lignende
funktionalitet findes for data gemt i den ekstra Seafile
filsynkroniserings-service. Her hedder den <em>del via e-post</em> og
tillader udover tilsvarende upload- og download-delinger ogs친 mulighed
for kodeord og tidsbegr칝nsning. Begge share link metoder inkluderer
muligheden for at udsende en invitation med link direkte p친 email, men
det kan naturligvis ogs친 g칮res manuelt via andre kanaler.
</p>
<h4 class="staticpage">Er det muligt at f친 et DOI til mit ERDA archive?</h4>
<p>
Ja, vi har fra juni 2018 haft DOI-registrering integreret.</br>
En del brugere har spurgt til muligheden for at tildele en
Digital Object Identifier (DOI) til deres publicerede ERDA archiver. Det
bliver mere og mere almindeligt at benytte DOIer i forskningsartikler i
tr친d med open-access og 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">Open science</a>-친nden.
KU har licens til at udstede DOIer
via <a href="https://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a> og KU-IT har
udviklet en service til form친let, som vi har integreret med ERDA.
I praksis laver du dit ERDA freeze archive som hidtil og s칮rger for at
v칝lge <em>yes</em> til Make Dataset Publicly Available. N친r du er
tilfreds med indholdet i arkivet klikker du <b>Finalize archive</b> for
at fryse det permanent. Derefter kan du benytte <b>Request archive DOI</b>-knappen 
fra View archive details til at g친 videre med KU DOI
registreringsformularen.<br/>
P친 KUNet findes
en <a href="https://kunet.ku.dk/arbejdsomraader/forskning/data/forskningsdata/data-doi/Sider/default.aspx" target="_blank">n칝rmere DOI-introduktion</a> inklusiv en trinvis
visuel gennemgang af hele processen med at lave et arkiv og tilknytte DOI.
</p>
<h4 class="staticpage">Hvordan styres Workgroups?</h4>
<p>
VIP- og TAP-ansatte kan oprette workgroups og de bliver derved
automatisk ejere af den nye workgroup. Al brugerstyring er ejernes
ansvar og foreg친r uden indblanding fra systemadministratorerne p친
ERDA. Medejere og medlemmer kan enten tilf칮jes direkte ved at indtaste
brugerens <em>svenske nummerplade</em> eller email p친 Workgroup
Management siden eller ved at brugere anmoder om owner-/membership p친
Workgroups-siden, og ejerne f칮lger de derved emailede instruktioner om
at tilf칮je brugeren vha det komplette bruger-ID.

<h4 class="staticpage">Ny ERDA-bruger: hvorfor f친r jeg 'No such user' eller 'No ID information received'?</h4>
<p>
Grundl칝ggende skal man igennem <i>tilmelding</i> f칮r man kan begynde at bruge
ERDA, jvf fremgangsm친den beskrevet i brugervejledningen.<br />
Hvis man alligevel fors칮ger med <i>log ind</i> f칮rst, kan man
efterf칮lgende opleve lidt af en ond cirkel med de ovenn칝vnte
fejlmeddelelser ved fors칮g p친 tilmelding. Pr칮v i s친 fald f칮lgende:<br />
1) 칀bn din web browser og g친 til ERDA-startsiden 
<a href="http://erda.ku.dk">http://erda.ku.dk</a> (her)<br />
2) Klik alt efter sprogindstilling knappen <b>tilmelding</b>
eller <b>sign up</b> 칮verst til venstre<br />
3a) Hvis du bliver m칮dt med en KU-login side, som den p친 side 5 i
brugervejledningen, er du p친 rette spor og kan bare indtaste dit KU-login
for at f칝rdigg칮re tilmeldingen og begynde at bruge ERDA.<br />
3b) Hvis du derimod kommer til en side med advarslen <i>No ID information received</i>,
betyder det at du allerede er delvist logget ind og f칮rst m친 igennem
lidt ekstra trin: klik p친 <b>Logout</b>-linket p친 den side og klik s친 p친
<b>Yes</b>-knappen derfra. N친r den siger <i>logged out</i> lukker du
f칮rst det aktive faneblad og s친 hele din web browser, inden du gentager
trinene fra (1) for forh친bentlig denne gang at n친 i m친l med (3a).
</p>
-->
<h4 class="staticpage">Hvorfor er der tegn jeg ikke kan bruge i filnavne?</h4>
<p>
ERDA afviser enkelte tegn s친 som 
"&lt; &gt; &#123; &#124; &#125; &#42; &#63; &#91; &#93;"
i filnavne. M친ske du allerede har oplevet lignende begr칝nsninger i
navngivningen af filer p친 din PC eller andre enheder.
For at kunne levere en sikker og ensartet brugeroplevelse p친 tv칝rs af
platforme, web og avancerede brugergr칝nseflader afviser ERDA disse og
visse andre som er kendt for at skabe problemer.
Hvadenten det er fordi de er s친kaldte kontroltegn med en speciel og
potentielt skadelig betydning p친 lagersystemerne eller fordi de vides at
forstyrre web-brug og -visning. Vi evaluerer l칮bende p친 behovet for at
tillade yderligere eksotiske tegn, hele tiden under krav om hverken at
skade brugergr칝nseflader eller bagvedliggende systemer. Du er
naturligvis velkommen til at kontakte os ang친ende at f친 yderligere tegn
du m친tte savne tilladt.
</p>
<h4 class="staticpage">Hvordan installerer og k칮rer jeg software XYZ i Jupyter?</h4>
<p>
Vi har integreret Jupyter i ERDA, s친 man som bruger kan lave interaktiv
dataanalyse i f.eks. Python eller R og med direkte adgang til alt sit
ERDA-data.<br/>
Jupyter-milj칮et har forskellige images med en stribe software-pakker
installeret, men nogle gange kan det stadig v칝re bekvemt at k칮re
yderligere special-software. Nogle udvidelser til Python og Jupyter kan
installeres midlertidigt med pip eller pip3 via en <em>Terminal</em> fra
Jupyter hovedsiden, eller ved at skrive en standard Python
<em>requirements.txt</em> fil i ens ERDA mappe og k칮re den ved Jupyter
opstart med noget i stil med 
<tt>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</tt> fra Jupyter-terminalen.<br/>
Man kan alternativt installere Python software-afh칝ngigheder som f.eks.
scikit-image pakken direkte i Jupyter Notebooks ved at evaluere
<tt>!pip3 install scikit-image</tt> i en celle.<br/>
I 칮jeblikket er installation af software som kr칝ver kompilering eller
har eksterne afh칝ngigheder typisk ikke underst칮ttet. Vi arbejder p친 at
udvikle en g칮r-det-selv tilpasning af Jupyter-instanserne, s친 det i noget
omfang bliver muligt. Indtil da er fremgangsm친den at skrive til vores
support-email med evt 칮nsker om yderligere software. S친 unders칮ger vi om
det er muligt at tilf칮je - men vi kan ikke love noget.
</p>
<h4 class="staticpage">Kan jeg f친 eller beholde en ERDA-konto uden en KU-konto?</h4>
<p>
Ja, s친l칝nge du har brug for en ERDA-konto til et projektsamarbejde med
en eller flere ansatte p친 KU, er det muligt at f친 en s친dan, ogs친 selv om
du ikke har en generel KU-konto. Ligeledes er det muligt at beholde
adgang til din ERDA-konto efter endt ans칝ttelse, s친fremt du har brug for
den til samarbejde med en vedblivende ansat.
<br/>
<span class="warningtext">
VIGTIGT: bem칝rk at KU-ledelsen har bedt om at s친danne brugere som ikke
er ansat p친 KU registrerer sig med eksplicit tilknytning til en lokal
bruger. S친 henvis venligst til din samarbejdspartner/vejleder p친 KU Science i
kommentarfeltet n친r du anmoder om OpenID- eller certifikat-adgang i
formularen beskrevet nedenfor.
</span>
<br />
Vores generelle adgangskontrol med brugernavn+kode, som beskrevet i
brugervejledningen, benytter OpenID-login fra KU Koncern-IT og er dermed
strengt knyttet til KUs brugerdatabase. Den kan derfor kun benyttes af
brugere med en KU-konto.
<br />
Vi tilbyder dog to alternativer for adgang uden en KU-konto. Den ene er
ligeledes med brugernavn+kode via vores egen selvst칝ndige OpenID-login
service og den anden benytter brugercertifikater for ekstra h칮j sikkerhed.
<br/>
Du kan tilmelde dig ERDA og f친 OpenID-adgang til din konto vha 
<em>Other User OpenID Signup</em>-knappen
under <a class="migoidsignup-link">tilmelding</a>. 
S친fremt du allerede har en ERDA-konto, som du blot gerne vil bevare
OpenID-adgang til, kan du benytte selvsamme side. Blot skal du v칝re
opm칝rksom p친 at udfylde formularens felter, s친 de stemmer n칮jagtig
overens med din nuv칝rende konto. Sp칮rg endelig hvis du er i tvivl.
<br/>
N친r systemadministratorerne p친 ERDA har godkendt din OpenID-konto/adgang, kan du
bruge din registrerede emailadresse sammen med din selvvalgte kode
til <a class="migoidlogin-link">log ind</a>.
<br/>
For den yderligere sikrede l칮sning skal du i stedet anmode om - og
installere et af vores grid-brugercertifikater, jvf den
tilh칮rende <a class="reqcert-da-link"> s친dan kommer du igang</a>
side. Som det fremg친r af user-cert-import guiden d칠r, kr칝ver
certifikat-installationen en del trin, men i det mindste er login s친
efterf칮lgende simplere. N친r du har installeret dit certifikat kan du
bruge det f칮rst i ERDAs <a class="extcertsignup-link">tilmelding</a> og
efterf칮lgende til <a class="extcertlogin-link">log ind</a>.
