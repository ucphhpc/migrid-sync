= Responsible Disclosure for MiGrid =
The SCIENCE HPC Center at the University of Copenhagen develops and
hosts a number of services under the migrid.org domains.

We are a small team with limited resources and rely on our own internal
security monitoring as well as the national DK-Cert monitoring. So we
do NOT have a bug/vulnerability reward program. Yet, we are of course
grateful for any bug or security reports, which might improve our
services or prevent abuse.

Like e.g. Google we do NOT consider the presence of version
information a security vulnerability in itself. Flaws affecting only
users of out-of-date browsers and software are similarly of limited
interest to us. Apart from such trivial cases, please report your
bug or security findings.
In case you want to pass any confidential information to us you can
use our supplied PGP/GPG public keys for encryption or send us an
initial message requesting a secure channel.
We generally strive to respond to all messages no later than the next
business day, but please bear with us if we don't always manage
that. In such cases we'd appreciate if you at least repeat your
inquiry and give us a few weeks before disclosing potential or
verified security issues to anyone else. 

You can find our contact details and other information in our
https://www.migrid.org/.well-known/security.txt
in line with the proposed new Internet standard described on
https://securitytxt.org/

Thanks in advance!

The MiGrid Team
