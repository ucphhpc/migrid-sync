    #   SSL Protocol Adjustments:
    #   The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
    #   approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't
    #   wait for the close notify alert from client. When you need a
    #   different shutdown approach you can use one of the following
    #   variables:
    #   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
    #     This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, 
    #     i.e. no SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.
    #     This violates the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some 
    #     brain-dead browsers. Use this when you receive I/O errors because
    #     of the standard approach where mod_ssl sends the close notify
    #     alert.
    #   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
    #     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, 
    #     i.e. a SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the
    #     close notify alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard
    #     compliant, but in practice often causes hanging connections with
    #     brain-dead browsers. Use this only for browsers where you know
    #     that their SSL implementation works correctly. 
    #   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the
    #   HTTP keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to
    #   disable keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable
    #   "nokeepalive" for this.
    #   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to
    #   workaround their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables
    #   "downgrade-1.0" and "force-response-1.0" for this.
    #
    # NB: The default setting of degrading ALL IE versions to 1.0 and no
    # keepalive is way too harsh. Changed to only include the unclean shutdown
    # which is still there at least in IE 6-9
    #SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" \
    #    nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
