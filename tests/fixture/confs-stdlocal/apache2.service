[Service]
# MiG NOTE: The default setup does not work for MiG forking httpd server, so we
# modified Type and ExecStart to avoid hang on service start
# Please see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=909703#c5
#Type=notify
Type=forking
EnvironmentFile=/etc/sysconfig/httpd
#ExecStart=/usr/sbin/httpd $OPTIONS -DFOREGROUND
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/httpd $OPTIONS -k start
ExecReload=/usr/sbin/httpd $OPTIONS -k graceful
ExecStop=/bin/kill -WINCH ${MAINPID}
# We want systemd to give httpd some time to finish gracefully, but still want
# it to kill httpd after TimeoutStopSec if something went wrong during the
# graceful stop. Normally, Systemd sends SIGTERM signal right after the
# ExecStop, which would kill httpd. We are sending useless SIGCONT here to give
# httpd time to finish.
KillSignal=SIGCONT
# MiG NOTE: The default setup limits store resource mounts to only the httpd
# process so we disabled PrivateTmp to make it show up in mounts and work 
# across all grid_X daemons
#PrivateTmp=true
PrivateTmp=false
