We are moving various scripts and tools into a more logical location and will
as a start just link to the existing paths in this folder so that one can use
them as
/path/to/bin/X
Long term we will likely move them there instead and perhaps only preserve
symlinks to still support the original paths for a while.

Some scripts and tools may still expect certain relative paths to e.g. the MiGserver.conf file but you can always override it with something like: 
MIG_CONF=/path/to/my/MiGserver.conf ./bin/searchusers.py
