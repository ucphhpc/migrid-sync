  1. Introduction
  ===============

The Python MiG Interface Module contains a set of functions intended for Minimum intrusion Grid users who want to develop grid applications. By grid application is meant a local client script that uses the grid as a computational resource by dispatching jobs to the grid server.

The module extends the Minimum intrusion Grid's "miglib.py" 
python module to further simplify grid operations and make them more
approachable to new users.


  2. Motivation
  =============

The learning curve for creating a grid application can be steep for
inexperienced grid developers because they must learn 
job and file management on the respective grid middleware. By 
building on top of the miglib.py module the MiG interface offers 
simple and intuitive functions that require little knowledge of the underlying 
platform.


  3. Features
  ===========

The MiG interface module offers three primary features:
-Transparency
-Local execution mode
-Error detection


	3.1. Transparency
	=================

An important part of the MiG middleware is to ensure anonymity between users and resources. Jobs are necessarily submitted via the MiG server using an mRSL job configuration script provided by the user. To simplify job submission the MiG interface module hides this intermediate step. Jobs are created as if the user was directly communicating with the resource without use for mRSL scripts.


	3.2. Local execution mode
	=========================

In local mode execution, the behaviour of MiG is emulated locally. Using an alternate backend for MiG operations, the jobs are instead dispatched as local processes. Because this avoids remote communication, development and debugging becomes more responsive and thus faster. When the application is working properly in local mode, switch it off to submit to the actual grid. Local mode utilises multicore architectures.


	3.3. Error detection
	====================

The MiG interface module has increased error detection at various critical stages to ensure that the user gets quick and precise error information. 


  4. Requirements
  ===============

- A unix platform operating system.
- Python (>=v2.5).
- Python (>=v2.6) for local mode execution.
- Curl (remote communication).
- A Minimum intrusion Grid user account with a valid 
certificate (for authentication).

= Getting Started = 
To run MiG jobs make sure that you have a MiG account and certificate. 
If not, go to the web site for more information (http://www.migrid.org) 

Make sure your certificate is properly installed to run MiG user scripts. Find a tutorial here
http://dk.migrid.org/public/doc/user_scripts/MiG-user-scripts.html

Test by running the directory listing script, migls.py. Finally, to verify that the MiG Interface Module works, run the examples in the Examples section below. It can be helpful to add the miginterface directory to your $PYTHONPATH environment variable, so it is globally accessible.

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/miginterface

= Examples =
Example grid applications using the mig interface module can be found 
in the /examples/ directory. They are intended for learning how to use the mig 
interface module and can be useful starting templates for 
developing customised grid applications.

To run an example file:

	python example1.py


  5. Documentation
  ================

For documentation please use pydoc to read the function 
descriptions available in the code.

	Example : pydoc miginterface.py
